[["\nA waverider is a hypersonic aircraft design that improves its supersonic lift-to-drag ratio by using the shock waves being generated by its own flight as a lifting surface, a phenomenon known as compression lift.", "The waverider remains a well-studied design for high-speed aircraft in the Mach 5 and higher hypersonic regime, although no such design has yet entered production.", "The Boeing X-51A scramjet demonstration aircraft was tested from 2010 to 2013.", "In its final test flight, it reached a speed of .", "The waverider design concept was first developed by Terence Nonweiler of the Queen's University of Belfast, and first described in print in 1951 as a re-entry vehicle.", "It consisted of a delta-wing platform with a low wing loading to provide considerable surface area to dump the heat of re-entry.", "At the time, Nonweiler was forced to use a greatly simplified 2D model of airflow around the aircraft, which he realized would not be accurate due to wikt:spanwise spanwise flow across the wing.", "However, he also noticed that the spanwise flow would be stopped by the shockwave being generated by the aircraft, and that if the wing was positioned to deliberately approach the shock, the spanwise flow would be trapped under wing, increasing pressure, and thus increasing lift.", "In the 1950s, the British started a space program based around the Blue Streak missile, which was, at some point, to include a manned vehicle.", "Armstrong-Whitworth were contracted to develop the re-entry vehicle, and unlike the U.S.", "space program they decided to stick with a winged vehicle instead of a ballistic space capsule capsule.", "Between 1957 and 1959, they contracted Nonweiler to develop his concepts further.", "This work produced a pyramid-shaped design with a flat underside and short wings.", "Heat was conducted through the wings to the upper cool surfaces, where it was dumped into the turbulent air on the top of the wing.", "In 1960, work on the Blue Streak was canceled as the missile was seen as being obsolete before it could have entered service.", "Work then moved to the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), where it continued as a research program into high-speed (Mach 4 to 7) civilian airliners.", "This work was discovered by engineers at North American Aviation during the early design studies of what would lead to the XB-70 bomber.", "They re-designed the original \"classic\" delta wing to incorporate drooping wing tips in order to trap the shock waves mechanically, rather than using a shock cone generated from the front of the aircraft.", "This mechanism also had two other beneficial effects; it reduced the amount of horizontal lifting surface at the rear of the aircraft, which helped offset a nose-down trim that occurs at high speeds, and it added more vertical surface which helped improve the directional stability, which decreased at high speed.", "Nonweiler's original design used the shock wave generated by the aircraft as a way to control spanwise flow, and thereby increase the amount of air trapped under the wing in the same way as a wing fence.", "While working on these concepts, he noticed that it was possible to shape the wing in such a way that the shock wave generated off its leading edge would form a horizontal sheet under the craft.", "In this case, the airflow would not only be trapped horizontally, spanwise, but vertically as well.", "The only area the air above the shock wave could escape would be out the back of the sheet where the fuselage ended.", "Since the air was trapped between this sheet and the fuselage, a large volume of air would be trapped, much more than the more basic approach he first developed.", "Furthermore, since the shock surface was held at a distance from the craft, shock heating was limited to the leading edges of the wings, lowering the thermal loads on the fuselage.", "In 1962 Nonweiler moved to Glasgow University to become Professor of Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics.", "That year his \"Delta Wings of Shapes Amenable to Exact Shock-Wave Theory\" was published by the ''Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society'', and earned him that society's Gold Medal.", "A craft generated using this model looks like a delta wing that has been broken down the center and the two sides folded downward.", "From the rear it looks like an upside-down V, or alternately, the \"caret\", ^, and such designs are known as \"caret wings\".", "Two to three years later the concept briefly came into the public eye, due to the airliner work at the RAE that led to the prospect of reaching Australia in 90 minutes.", "Newspaper articles led to an appearance on Scottish Television.", "Hawker Siddeley examined the caret wing waverider in the later 1960s as a part of a three-stage lunar rocket design.", "The first stage was built on an expanded Blue Steel (missile) Blue Steel, the second a waverider, and the third a nuclear-powered manned stage.", "This work was generalized in 1971 to produce a two-staged reusable spacecraft.", "The  long first stage was designed as a classical waverider, with air-breathing engine air-breathing propulsion for return to the launch site.", "The upper stage was designed as a lifting body, and would have carried an 8000-pound (3.6&nbsp;t) payload to low Earth orbit.", "Nonweiler's work was based on studies of planar 2D shocks due to the difficulty understanding and predicting real-world shock patterns around 3D bodies.", "As the study of hypersonic flows improved, researchers were able to study waverider designs that used different shockwave shapes, the simplest being the conical shock generated by a cone.", "In these cases, a waverider is designed to keep the rounded shockwave attached to its wings, not a flat sheet, which increases the volume of air trapped under the surface, and thereby increases lift.", "Unlike the caret wing, the cone flow designs smoothly curve their wings, from near horizontal in the center, to highly drooped where they meet the shock.", "Like the caret wing, they have to be designed to operate at a specific speed to properly attach the shock wave to the wing's leading edge, but unlike them the entire body shape can be varied dramatically at the different design speeds, and sometimes have wingtips that curve upward to attach to the shockwave.", "Further development of the conical sections, adding canopies and fuselage areas, led to the \"osculating cones waverider\", which develops several conical shock waves at different points on the body, blending them to produce a single shaped shock.", "The expansion to a wider range of compression surface flows allowed the  design of waveriders with control of volume,\nDuring this period at least one waverider was tested at the Woomera Test Facility Woomera Rocket Range, mounted on the nose of an air-launched Blue Steel missile, and a number of airframes were tested in the wind tunnel at NASA's Ames Research Center.", "However, during the 1970s most work in hypersonics disappeared, and the waverider along with it.", "One of the many differences between supersonic and hypersonic flight concerns the interaction of the boundary layer and the shock waves generated from the nose of the aircraft.", "Normally the boundary layer is quite thin compared to the streamline of airflow over the wing, and can be considered separately from other aerodynamic effects.", "However, as the speed increases and the shock wave increasingly approaches the sides of the craft, there comes a point where the two start to interact and the flowfield becomes very complex.", "Long before that point, the boundary layer starts to interact with the air trapped between the shock wave and the fuselage, the air that is being used for lift on a waverider.", "Calculating the effects of these interactions was beyond the abilities of aerodynamics until the introduction of useful computational fluid dynamics starting in the 1980s.", "In 1981, Maurice Rasmussen at the University of Oklahoma started a waverider renaissance by publishing a paper on a new 3D underside shape using these techniques.", "These shapes have superior lifting performance and less drag.", "Since then, whole families of Projective cone cone-derived waveriders have been designed using more and more complex conic shocks, based on more complex software.", "This work eventually led to a conference in 1989, the ''First International Hypersonic Waverider Conference'', held at the University of Maryland.", "These newest shapes, the \"viscous optimized waveriders\", look similar to conical designs as long as the angle of the shock wave on the nose is beyond some critical angle, about 14 degrees for a Mach 6 design for instance.", "The angle of the shock can be controlled by widening out the nose into a curved plate of specific radius, and reducing the radius produces a smaller shock cone angle.", "Vehicle design starts by selecting a given angle and then developing the body shape that traps that angle, then repeating this process for different angles.", "For any given speed, a single shape will generate the best results.", "During re-entry, hypersonic vehicles generate lift only from the underside of the fuselage.", "The underside, which is inclined to the flow at a high angle of attack, creates lift in reaction to the vehicle wedging the airflow downwards.", "The amount of lift is not particularly high, compared to a traditional wing, but more than enough to maneuver given the amount of distance the vehicle covers.", "Most re-entry vehicles have been based on the Riabouchinsky solid blunt-nose reentry design pioneered by Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n.", "He demonstrated that a shock wave is forced to \"detach\" from a curved surface, forced out into a larger configuration that requires considerable energy to form.", "Energy expended in forming this shock wave is no longer available as heat, so this shaping can dramatically reduce the heat load on the spacecraft.", "Such a design has been the basis for almost every re-entry vehicle since, found on the blunt noses of the early ICBM warheads, the bottoms of the various NASA capsules, and the large nose of the Space Shuttle.", "The problem with the blunt-nose system is that the resulting design creates very little lift, meaning the vehicle has problems maneuvering during re-entry.", "If the spacecraft is meant to be able to return to its point of launch \"on command\", then some sort of maneuvering will be required to counteract the fact that the Earth is turning under the spacecraft as it flies.", "After a single low Earth orbit, the launching point will be over  to the east of the spacecraft by the time it has completed one full orbit.", "A considerable amount of research was dedicated to combining the blunt-nose system with wings, leading to the development of the lifting body designs in the U.S.", "It was while working on one such design that Nonweiler developed the waverider.", "He noticed that the detachment of the shock wave over the blunt leading edges of the wings of the Armstrong-Whitworth design would allow the air on the bottom of the craft to flow spanwise and escape to the upper part of the wing through the gap between the leading edge and the detached shock wave.", "This loss of airflow reduced (by up to a quarter) the lift being generated by the waverider, which led to studies on how to avoid this problem and keep the flow trapped under the wing.", "Nonweiler's resulting design is a delta-wing with some amount of negative dihedral (aircraft) dihedral \u2014 the wings are bent down from the fuselage towards the tips.", "When viewed from the front, the wing resembles a caret symbol (\nWaveriders generally have sharp noses and sharp leading edges on their wings.", "The underside shock-surface remains attached to this.", "Air flowing in through the shock surface is trapped between the shock and the fuselage, and can only escape at the rear of the fuselage.", "With sharp edges, all the lift is retained.", "Even though sharp edges get much hotter than rounded ones at the same air density, the improved lift means that waveriders can glide on re-entry at much higher altitudes where the air density is lower.", "A list ranking various space vehicles in order of heating applied to the airframe would have space capsule capsules at the top (re-entering quickly with very high heating loads), waveriders at the bottom (extremely long gliding profiles at high altitude), and the Space Shuttle somewhere in the middle.", "Simple waveriders have substantial design problems.", "First, the obvious designs only work at a particular Mach number, and the amount of lift captured will change dramatically as the vehicle changes speed.", "Another problem is that the waverider depends on radiative cooling, possible as long as the vehicle spends most of its time at very high altitudes.", "However these altitudes also demand a very large wing to generate the needed lift in the thin air, and that same wing can become rather unwieldy at lower altitudes and speeds.", "Because of these problems, waveriders have not found favor with practical aerodynamic designers, despite the fact that they might make long-distance hypersonic vehicles efficient enough to carry air freight.", "Some researchers controversially claim that there are designs that overcome these problems.", "One candidate for a multi-speed waverider is a \"caret wing\", operated at different angles of attack.", "A caret wing is a delta wing with longitudinal conical or triangular leading edge slot slots or strake (aviation) strakes.", "It strongly resembles a paper airplane or rogallo wing.", "The correct angle of attack would become increasingly precise at higher mach numbers, but this is a control problem that is theoretically solvable.", "The wing is said to perform even better if it can be constructed of tight mesh, because that reduces its drag, while maintaining lift.", "Such wings are said to have the unusual attribute of operating at a wide range of mach numbers in different fluids with a wide range of Reynolds numbers.", "The temperature problem can be solved with some combination of a transpiring surface, exotic materials, and possibly heatpipe heat-pipes.", "In a transpiring surface, small amounts of a coolant such as water are pumped through small holes in the aircraft's skin (see transpiration and perspiration).", "This design works for Mach&nbsp;25 spacecraft Atmospheric_entry#Ablative re-entry shields, and therefore should work for any aircraft that can carry the weight of the coolant.", "Exotic materials such as Reinforced carbon-carbon carbon-carbon composite do not conduct heat but endure it, but they tend to be brittle.", "Heatpipes are not widely used at present.", "Like a conventional heat exchanger, they conduct heat better than most solid materials, but like a thermosiphon are passively pumped.", "The Boeing X-51A deals with external heating through the use of a tungsten nosecone and space shuttle-style heat shield tiles on its belly.", "Internal (engine) heating is absorbed by using the JP-7 fuel as a coolant prior to combustion.", "Other high temperature materials, referred to as SHARP materials (typically zirconium diboride and hafnium diboride) have been used on steering vanes for ICBM reentry vehicles since the 1970s, and are proposed for use on hypersonic vehicles.", "They are said to permit Mach 11 flight at  altitudes and Mach 7 flight at sea level.", "These materials are more structurally rugged than the Reinforced Carbon Composite (RCC) used on the space shuttle nose and leading edges, have higher radiative and temperature tolerance properties, and do not suffer from oxidation issues that RCC needs to be protected against with coatings.", "Aerodynamics\nAerospace

the boat to head slightly to windward in stronger gusts, to some extent self-feathering the sails.", "Other sailors disagree and prefer a neutral helm.", "The fundamental cause of \"helm\", be it weather or lee, is the relationship of the center of pressure of the sail plan to the center of lateral resistance of the hull.", "If the center of pressure is astern of the center of lateral resistance, a weather helm, the tendency of the vessel is to want to turn into the wind.", "If the situation is reversed, with the center of pressure forward of the center of lateral resistance of the hull, a \"lee\" helm will result, which is generally considered undesirable, if not dangerous.", "Too much of either helm is not good, since it forces the helmsman to hold the rudder deflected to counter it, thus inducing extra drag beyond what a vessel with neutral or minimal helm would experience.", "A stable configuration is desirable not only in sailing, but in aircraft design as well.", "Aircraft design therefore borrowed the term center of pressure.", "And like a sail, a rigid non-symmetrical airfoil not only produces lift, but a moment (physics) moment.", "The center of pressure of an aircraft is the point where all of the aerodynamic pressure field may be represented by a single force vector with no moment.", "A similar idea is the aerodynamic center which is the point on an

an important role in analysis of the longitudinal static stability of all flying machines.", "It is desirable that when the pitch angle and angle of attack of an aircraft are disturbed (by, for example wind shear/vertical gust) that the aircraft returns to its original trimmed pitch angle and angle of attack without a pilot or autopilot changing the control surface deflection.", "For an aircraft to return towards its trimmed attitude, without input from a pilot or autopilot, it must have positive longitudinal static stability.", "Missiles typically do not have a preferred plane or direction of maneuver and thus have symmetric airfoils.", "Since the center of pressure for symmetric airfoils is relatively constant for small angle of attack, missile engineers typically speak of the complete center of pressure of the entire vehicle for stability and control analysis.", "In missile analysis, the center of pressure is typically defined as the center of the additional pressure field due to a change in the angle of attack off of the trim angle of attack.<ref>Moore, F.G., Approximate Methods for Weapon Aerodynamics, AIAA Progress in Astronatuics and Aeronautics, Volume 186\n</ref>\nFor unguided rockets the trim position is typically zero angle of attack and the center of pressure is defined to be the center of pressure of the resultant flow field on the entire vehicle resulting from a very small angle of attack (that is, the center of pressure in the limit as angle of attack goes to zero).", "For positive stability in missiles, the total vehicle center of pressure defined as given above must be further from the nose of the vehicle than the center of gravity.", "In missiles at lower angles of attack, the contributions to the center of pressure are dominated by the nose, wings, and fins.", "The normalized normal force coefficient derivative with respect to the angle of attack of each component multiplied by the location of the center of pressure can be used to compute a centroid representing the total center of pressure.", "The center of pressure of the added flow field is behind the center of gravity and the additional force \"points\" in the direction of the added angle of attack; this produces a moment that pushes the vehicle back to the trim position.", "In guided missiles where the fins can be moved to trim the vehicles in different angles of attack, the center of pressure is the center of pressure of the flow field at that angle of attack for the undeflected fin position.", "This is the center of pressure of any small change in the angle of attack (as defined above).", "Once again for positive static stability, this definition of center of pressure requires that the center of pressure be further from the nose than the center of gravity.", "This ensures that any increased forces resulting from increased angle of attack results in increased restoring moment to drive the missile back to the trimmed position.", "In missile analysis, positive static margin implies that the complete vehicle makes a restoring moment for any angle of attack from the trim position.", "The center of pressure on a symmetric airfoil typically lies close to 25% of the chord length behind the leading edge of the airfoil.", "(This is called the \"quarter-chord point\".)", "For a symmetric airfoil, as angle of attack and lift coefficient change, the center of pressure does not move.", "It remains around the quarter-chord point for angles of attack below the stalling angle of attack.", "The role of center of pressure in the control characterization of aircraft takes a different form than in missiles.", "On a Camber (aerodynamics) cambered airfoil the center of pressure does not occupy a fixed location.", "For a conventionally cambered airfoil, the center of pressure lies a little behind the quarter-chord point at maximum lift coefficient (large angle of attack), but as lift coefficient reduces (angle of attack reduces) the center of pressure moves toward the rear.", "When the lift coefficient is zero an airfoil is generating no lift but a conventionally cambered airfoil generates a nose-down pitching moment, so the location of the center of pressure is an infinite distance behind the airfoil.", "For a Camber (aerodynamics)#Definition reflex-cambered airfoil, the center of pressure lies a little ahead of the quarter-chord point at maximum lift coefficient (large angle of attack), but as lift coefficient reduces (angle of attack reduces) the center of pressure moves forward.", "When the lift coefficient is zero an airfoil is generating no lift but a reflex-cambered airfoil generates a nose-up pitching moment, so the location of the center of pressure is an infinite distance ahead of the airfoil.", "This direction of movement of the center of pressure on a reflex-cambered airfoil has a stabilising effect.", "The way the center of pressure moves as lift coefficient changes makes it difficult to use the center of pressure in the mathematical analysis of longitudinal static stability of an aircraft.", "For this reason, it is much simpler to use the aerodynamic center when carrying out a mathematical analysis.", "The aerodynamic center occupies a fixed location on an airfoil, typically close to the quarter-chord point.", "The aerodynamic center is the conceptual starting point for longitudinal stability.", "The Stabilizer (aircraft) horizontal stabilizer contributes extra stability and this allows the center of gravity to be a small distance aft of the aerodynamic center

difficulties.", "The most common configuration is having the central engine located in the rear fuselage and supplied with air by an S-duct S-shaped duct; this is used on the Hawker Siddeley Trident, Boeing 727, Tupolev Tu-154, Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, and, more recently, the Dassault Falcon 7X.", "The S-duct has low drag, and since the third engine is mounted closer to the centerline, the aircraft will normally be easy to handle in the event of an engine failure.", "However, S-duct designs are extremely complex and costly.", "Furthermore, the central engine bay would require structural changes in the event of a major re-engining.", "For example, the 727's central bay was only wide enough to fit a low-bypass turbofan and not the newer high-bypass turbofans which were quieter and more powerful.", "Boeing decided that a redesign was too expensive and ended its production instead of pursuing further development.", "The Lockheed Tristar's tail section was too short to fit an existing two-spool engine as it was designed only to accommodate the new three-spool Rolls-Royce RB211 engine, and delays in the RB211's development in turn pushed back the TriStar's entry into service which affected sales.", "The McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and related McDonnell Douglas MD-11 MD-11 use an alternative \"straight-through\" layout, which allows for easier engine installation, modification, and access.", "It also has the additional benefit of being much easier to re-engine.", "However, this sacrifices aerodynamics compared to the S-duct.", "Also, as the engine is located much higher up than the wing-mounted engines, an engine failure will produce a greater pitching moment, making it more difficult to control.", "Placement of the remaining two engines varies.", "Most smaller aircraft, like the Hawker Siddeley Trident, the Boeing 727 and the Tupolev Tu-154 have two side-mount engine pylons in a T-tail configuration.", "The larger widebody Lockheed TriStar and DC-10/MD-11 mount an engine underneath each wing.", "Preliminary studies were done on the TriStar to reuse the fuselage and wing for a twinjet design though these never materialized due to Lockheed's lack of funds.", "Additionally in the late-1990s Boeing, which had taken over McDonnell Douglas, considered removing the tail engine from the MD-11 to make it a twinjet but ending up instead ending its production altogether, as the Boeing 767 767 and Boeing 777 777 would have cannibalized it.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\nOne major advantage of the trijet design is that the wings can be located further aft on the fuselage, compared to twinjets and quadjets with all wing-mounted engines, allowing main cabin exit and entry doors to be more centrally located for quicker boarding and deplaning, ensuring shorter turnaround times.", "The rear-mounted engine and wings shift the aircraft's center of gravity rearwards, improving fuel efficiency, although this will also make the plane slightly less stable and more difficult to handle during takeoff and landing.", "(The McDonnell Douglas DC-9 twinjet and its derivatives, whose engines are mounted on pylons near the rear empennage, have similar advantages/disadvantages of the trijet design, such as the wings located further aft and a more rearward center of gravity.)", "Trijets are more efficient and cheaper than four-engine aircraft, as the engines are the most expensive part of the plane and having more engines consumes more fuel, particularly if quadjets and trijets share engines of similar power, making the trijet configuration more suited to a mid-size airliner compared to larger quadjets.", "However, higher purchase prices, primarily due to the difficulty and complexity of mounting the third engine through the tail, will somewhat negate this advantage.", "Due to their added thrust, trijets will have slightly improved takeoff performance compared to twinjets if an engine fails.", "Because takeoff performance for aircraft is usually calculated to include an extra margin to account for a possible engine failure, trijets are better able to take off from hot and high airports or those where terrain clearance near the runway is an issue.", "Unlike twinjets, trijets are not required to land immediately at the nearest suitable airport if one engine fails (this advantage is also shared with quadjets).", "This is advantageous if the aircraft is not near one of the operator's maintenance bases, as the pilots may then continue the flight and land at an airport where it is more suitable to perform repairs.", "Additionally, for trijets on the ground with one engine inoperative, approval can be granted to perform two-engine ferry flights.", "Prior to the introduction of ETOPS, only trijets and quadjets were able to perform long international flights over areas without any diversion airports.", "However, this advantage has largely disappeared in recent years as ETOPS-certified twin-engined aircraft are able to do so as well.", "The biggest obstacle trijets face today is operating costs, primarily fuel efficiency, as a three-engine design almost certainly consumes more fuel than a comparable two-engine design.", "This also greatly increases the difficulty of marketing a new trijet aircraft today, especially for passenger service.", "However this was worth the trade off between 1970 and the 1990s when trijets and twinjets shared engines of similar output, such as when the DC-10, MD-11, and Airbus's A300 and A330 were all powered by the General Electric CF6, and the additional power from the third engine gave the DC-10/MD-11 advantages in longer range and/or heavier payload over the A300/A330 twinjet.", "Since the 1990s, with further advancements in high-bypass turbofan technology, large twinjets have been equipped with purpose-designed engines like the Boeing 777's General Electric GE90, allowing twinjets to perform the same tasks as most trijets and even many quadjets but more efficiently.", "The first trijet design to fly was the Tupolev Tu-73 bomber prototype, first flown in 1947.", "The first commercial trijets were the Hawker Siddeley Trident (1962) and the Boeing 727 (1963).", "Both were compromises to meet airline requirements; in the case of the Trident, it was to meet BEA's changing needs, while the 727 had to be acceptable for three different airlines.", "Although collaboration between the manufacturers was considered, it did not come about.", "Early American twinjet designs were limited by the Federal Aviation Administration FAA's ETOPS 60-minute rule, whereby the flight path of twin-engine jetliners was restricted to within 60 minutes' flying time from a suitable airport, in case of engine failure.", "In 1964, this rule was lifted for trijet designs, as they had a greater safety margin.", "For second-generation jet airliners, with the innovations of the high-bypass turbofan for greater efficiency and reduced noise, and the Wide-body aircraft wide-body (twin-aisle) for greater passenger/cargo capacity, the trijet design was seen as the optimal configuration for the medium wide-body jet airliner, sitting in terms of size, range, and cost between quadjets (four-engine aircraft) and twinjets, and this led to a flurry of trijet designs.", "The four-engine Boeing 747 was popular for transoceanic flights due to its long-range and large size, but it was expensive and not all routes were able to fill its seating capacity, while the original models of the Airbus A300 twinjet were limited to short- to medium-range distances.", "During this period, different jet airliners shared engines of similar output, such as when the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, Airbus A300, and Boeing 767 were powered by the General Electric CF6, the additional power from the third engine gave the DC-10 advantages in longer range and/or heavier payload over the A300 and 767 twinjets.", "Thus trijet designs such as the DC-10 and L-1011 TriStar represented the best compromise with medium- to long-range and medium size that US airlines sought for their domestic and transatlantic routes.", "As a result of these trijet wide-bodies, as well as the popularity of the Boeing 727, in their heyday of the 1980s trijets made up a majority of all such US jet airliners.", "From 1985 to 2003 the number of such planes in service had sunk from 1488 to 602.", "The number of twinjets, on the other hand, had more than quadrupled in the same period.", "Both Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas were financially weakened competing in the widebody market, which led to Lockheed ending production of the L-1011 in 1984 after producing only half the units needed to break even, while a number of fatal DC-10 crashes also slowed its sales.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> In 1984 Boeing ended production of the 727, as its central engine bay would require an extremely expensive redesign to accommodate quieter high-bypass turbofans, and it was soon supplanted by Airbus with their Airbus 320 A320 and Boeing with their Boeing 737 737 and Boeing 757 757.", "Further advancements in high-bypass turbofan technology and a subsequent relaxation in airline safety rules made the trijet and even the quadjet nearly obsolete for passenger services, as their range and payload could be covered more efficiently with large twinjets powered with purpose-designed engines such as the Boeing 777 777's General Electric GE90.", "During the 1980s, McDonnell Douglas was the only Western manufacturer to continue development of the trijet design with an update to the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 DC-10, the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 MD-11, which initially held a range and payload advantage over its closest medium wide-body competitors which were twinjets, the in-production Boeing 767 and upcoming Airbus A330.", "McDonnell Douglas had planned a new trijet called the MD-XX, which were lengthened versions of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 MD-11.", "The MD-XX Long Range aircraft would have been capable of travelling distances up to 8,320 nautical miles and had a wingspan of 213 feet.", "The project was cancelled in 1996, one year before McDonnell Douglas was acquired by Boeing.", "Boeing ended production of the MD-11 after filling remaining customer orders since the MD-11 would have competed with the 767 and 777.", "A study to remove the MD-11's tail-mounted engine (which would have made it a twinjet) never came to fruition as it would have been very expensive, and the MD-11 had very little in common in terms of design or type rating with other Boeing airliners.", "In contrast to McDonnell Douglas sticking with their existing trijet configuration, Airbus (which never produced a trijet aircraft) and Boeing worked on new widebody twinjet designs that would become the A330 and 777, respectively.", "The MD-11's long range advantage was brief as it soon was threatened by the A330's four-engine derivative, the Airbus A340 A340, and the 777.", "The only other notable trijet development during the 1980s was in the Soviet Union, where the Tupolev Tu-154 was re-engined with the Soloviev D-30 engine as well as a new wing design and entered serial production from 1984 as the Tu-154M.", "With the exception of the Dassault Falcon 7X, Dassault Falcon 7X Falcon 8x, and Dassault Falcon 900 Falcon 900, no manufacturer now produces three-engine airliners.", "Modern engines have extremely low failure rates and can generate much higher shaft power and thrust than early types.", "This makes twinjets more suitable than they were before for long-haul trans-oceanic operations, resulting in eased ETOPS restrictions; modern wide-body twin-engine jets usually have an ETOPS 180 or even (in the case of the Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner 787) ETOPS 330 rating.", "As such, having more than two engines is no longer considered necessary, except for very large or heavy aircraft such as the Boeing 747, Airbus A380 (over 400 seats in a mixed-class configuration), Antonov An-124, and Antonov An-225 An-225, or for flights through the Southern Hemisphere, primarily to and from Australia (which has not yet adopted the ETOPS 330 standard), where the most direct route for some flights is over Antarctica.", "Today, both narrow-body aircraft narrow-body and wide body aircraft wide-body trijet production has ceased for almost all commercial aircraft, being replaced by twinjets.", "As of 2016, the Falcon 7X, 8X, and 900 business jets, all of which use S-ducts, are the only trijets in production.", "Some old models, such as the Boeing 727 727, Tupolev Tu-154 Tu-154, DC-10, and MD-11, have found second careers as cargo aircraft, as well as limited charter, governmental, and military service.", "The most widely used trijets are the DC-10 and the MD-11, mostly operated by UPS Airlines and FedEx Express in cargo service.", "For private and corporate operators, where fuel efficiency is often less important than for airlines, trijets may still be of interest due to their immunity from ETOPS and ability to take off from shorter runways.", "As a result, a sizeable number of trijets, such as 727s and newly-built Dassault Falcons, are in use by private operators and corporate flight departments.", "Airbus filed a patent in 2008 for a new, twin-tail trijet design, whose tail engine appears to use a \"straight\" layout similar to the MD-11, but it is unknown when or if this will be developed or produced.", "However, the proposed Boeing X-48 blended wing body design, Lockheed's N+2 design study, and Aerion AS2 supersonic business jet also have three engines.", "The AS2 is currently taking orders and a wooden mockup has been constructed.", "Boom Technology's planned Boom Technology Overture Overture

system that prevents the pilot of an aircraft from making control commands that would force the aircraft to exceed its structural and aerodynamic operating limits.", "It is used in some form in all modern commercial fly-by-wire aircraft.", "The professed advantage of flight envelope protection systems is that they restrict a pilot's excessive control inputs, whether in surprise reaction to emergencies or otherwise, from translating into excessive flight control surface movements.", "Notionally, this allows pilots to react quickly to an emergency while blunting the effect of an excessive control input resulting from \"startle,\" by electronically limiting excessive control surface movements that could over-stress the airframe and endanger the safety of the aircraft.", "In practice, these limitations have sometimes resulted in unintended human factors errors and accidents of their own.", "Aircraft have a flight envelope that describes its safe performance limits in regard to such things as minimum and maximum operating speeds, and its operating structural strength.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/><ref name=\"Abzug\"/><ref name=\"Risukhin\"/> Flight envelope protection calculates that flight envelope (and adds a margin of safety) and uses this information to stop aviator pilots from making control inputs that would put the aircraft outside that flight envelope.<ref name=\"Waldrop\"/> The interference of the flight envelope protection system with the pilot's commands can happen in two different ways (which can also be combined):\n* Ignoring part or all of an control input that would bring an aircraft's state of flight closer to or even outside of its operational borders.", "This method is applied in most sidestick-controlled fly-by-wire aircraft with rate command.", "* Inform the pilot that the respective command is bringing the aircraft closer to the calculated operational borders; this communication can happen by simple alarms or tactile feedback.", "This method is often applied in aircraft with conventional controls.", "For example, if the pilot uses the rearward side-stick to Roll, pitch, and yaw pitch the aircraft nose up, the control computers creating the flight envelope protection can prevent the pilot pitching the aircraft beyond the Stall (flight) stalling angle of attack: \n*In the first case, if the pilot tries to apply even more rearward control, the flight envelope protection would cause the aircraft to ignore this command.<ref name=\"North\"/><ref name=\"Waldrop\"/> Flight envelope protection can in this way increase aircraft safety by allowing the pilot to apply maximum control forces in an emergency while not at the same time inadvertently putting the aircraft outside the margins of its operational safety.", "Examples of where this might stop Aviation accidents and incidents air accidents are when it allows a pilot to make a quick evasive maneuver in response to a ground proximity warning system warning, or in quick response to an approaching aircraft and a potential mid air collision.<ref name=\"North\"/> In this case without a flight envelope protection system, \"you would probably hold back from maneuvering as hard as you could for fear of tumbling out of control, or worse.", "You would have to sneak up on it 2.5 G, the design limit, and when you got there you wouldn't be able to tell, because very few commercial pilots have ever flown 2.5 G. But in the Airbus A320 family A320, you wouldn't have to hesitate: you could just slam the controller all the way to the side and instantly get out of there as fast as the plane will take you.", "\"<ref name=\"Waldrop\"/> Thus the makers of the Airbus argue: \"envelope protection doesn't constrain the pilot.", "It liberates the pilot from uncertainty \u2013 and thus enhances safety.", "\"<ref name=\"Waldrop\"/> \n*In the second case, e.g.", "when using a Haptic technology force-feedback-system to communicate with the pilot, if the pilot tries to apply even more rearward control, the flight envelope protection would present increasing counterforces on the controls so that the pilot has to apply increasing force in order to continue the control input that is perceived as dangerous by the flight envelope protection.", "While most designers of modern fly-by-wire aircraft stick to either one of these to solutions ('sidestick-control & no feedback' or 'conventional control & feedback', see also below), there are also approaches in science to combine both of them: As a study demonstrated, Haptic technology force-feedback applied to the side-stick of an aircraft controlled via role rate and g-load (as e.g.", "an modern Airbus aircraft) can be used to increase adherence to a save flight envelope and thus reduce the risk of pilots entering dangerous states of flights outside the operational borders while maintaining the pilots' final authority and increasing their situation awareness.", "The Airbus A320 family Airbus A320 was the first commercial aircraft to incorporate full flight-envelope protection into its flight-control software.", "This was instigated by former Airbus senior vice president for engineering Bernard Ziegler.", "In the Airbus, the flight envelope protection cannot be overridden completely, although the crew can fly beyond flight envelope limits by selecting an alternate \"control law\".", "Boeing in the Boeing 777 has taken a different approach by allowing the crew to override flight envelope limits using excessive force on the flight controls.", "One objection raised against flight envelope protection is the incident that happened to China Airlines Flight 006, a Boeing 747SP Boeing 747SP-09, northwest of San Francisco in 1985.<ref name=\"Waldrop\"/> In this flight incident, the crew was forced to overstress (and structurally damage) the horizontal tail surfaces in order to recover from a Aerobatic maneuver roll and near-vertical dive.", "(This had been caused by an automatic disconnect of the autopilot and incorrect handling of a yaw brought about by an engine flame-out).", "The pilot recovered control with about 10,000&nbsp;ft of altitude remaining (from its original high-altitude cruise).", "But to do that the pilot had to pull the aircraft with an estimated 5.5 G, or more than twice its design limits.<ref name=\"Waldrop\"/> Had the aircraft \nincorporated a flight envelope protection system, this excessive manoeuvre could not have been performed, greatly reducing chances of recovery.", "Against this objection, Airbus has responded that an A320 in the situation of Flight 006 \"never would have fallen out of the air\nin the first place: the envelope protection would have automatically kept it in level flight in spite of the drag of a stalled engine\".<ref name=\"Waldrop\"/>\nFedEx Flight 705, in April 1995, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, was a case of a FedEx Flight Engineer who, facing a dismissal, attempted to hijack the plane and crash it into FedEx Headquarters in order for his family to collect his life insurance policy.", "After being attacked and severely injured, the flight crew was able to fight back and land the plane safely.", "In order to keep the attacker off balance and out of the cockpit the crew had to perform extreme maneuvers, including a barrel roll and a dive so fast the airplane couldn't measure its airspeed.", "Had the crew not been able to exceed the plane's flight envelope, the crew might not have been successful .", "American Airlines Flight 587, an Airbus A300, crashed in November 2001, when the vertical stabilizer broke off due to excessive rudder inputs made by the pilot.", "A flight-envelope protection system could have prevented this crash, though it can still be argued that an override button should be provided for contingencies when the pilots are aware of the need to exceed normal limits.", "US Airways Flight 1549, an Airbus A320, experienced a dual engine failure after a bird strike and subsequently landed safely in the Hudson River in January 2009.", "The NTSB accident report mentions the effect of flight envelope protection: ''\"The airplane\u2019s airspeed in the last 150 feet of the descent was low enough to activate the alpha-protection mode of the airplane\u2019s fly-by-wire envelope protection features...

maneuver, is a maneuver in which a spacecraft falls into a gravitational well, and then accelerates when it's falling, thus reaching additional speed.", "The resulting maneuver is a more efficient way to gain kinetic energy than applying the same impulse (physics) impulse outside of a gravitational well.", "The gain in efficiency is explained by the Oberth effect, wherein the use of an engine at higher speeds generates greater mechanical energy than use at lower speeds.", "In practical terms, this means that the most energy-efficient method for a spacecraft to burn its engine is at the lowest possible Apsis orbital periapsis, when its orbital velocity (and so, its kinetic energy) is greatest.", "The Oberth effect is strongest at a point in orbit known as the Apsis periapsis, where the gravitational potential is lowest, and the speed is highest.", "This is because firing a rocket engine at high speed causes a greater change in kinetic energy than when fired at lower speed.", "Because the vehicle remains near periapsis only for a short time, for the Oberth maneuver to be most effective the vehicle must be able to generate as much impulse as possible in the shortest possible time.", "Thus, the Oberth maneuver is much more useful for high-thrust rocket engines like liquid-propellant rockets, and less useful for low-thrust reaction engines such as ion drives, which take a long time to gain speed.", "The Oberth effect also can be used to understand the behavior of multi-stage rockets: the upper stage can generate much more usable kinetic energy than the total chemical energy of the propellants it carries.<ref name=ways/>\nThe Oberth effect occurs because the propellant has more usable energy due to its kinetic energy in addition to its chemical potential energy.<ref name=ways/> The vehicle is able to employ this kinetic energy to generate more mechanical power.", "Rocket engines produce the same force regardless of their velocity.", "A rocket acting on a fixed object, as in a static firing, does no useful work at all; the rocket's stored energy is entirely expended on accelerating its propellant in the form of exhaust.", "But when the rocket moves, its thrust acts through the distance it moves.", "Force multiplied by distance is the definition of mechanical work mechanical energy or work.", "So the farther the rocket and payload move during the burn (i.e.", "the faster they move), the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the rocket and its payload and the less to its exhaust.", "This is shown as follows.", "The mechanical work done on the rocket () is defined as the dot product of the force of the engine's thrust () and the displacement it travels during the burn ():\n: \nIf the burn is made in the Retrograde and prograde motion prograde direction, .", "The work results in a change in kinetic energy\n: \nDifferentiating with respect to time, we obtain \n: \nor\n: \nwhere  is the velocity.", "Dividing by the instantaneous mass  to express this in terms of Specific energy#Astrodynamics specific energy (), we get \n: \nwhere  is the proper acceleration acceleration vector.", "Thus it can be readily seen that the rate of gain of specific energy of every part of the rocket is proportional to speed and, given this, the equation can be integrated (Numerical integration numerically or otherwise) to calculate the overall increase in specific energy of the rocket.", "Integrating the above energy equation is often unnecessary if the burn duration is short.", "Short burns of chemical rocket engines close to periapsis or elsewhere are usually mathematically modelled as impulsive burns, where the force of the engine dominates any other forces that might change the vehicle's energy over the burn.", "For example, as a vehicle falls towards periapsis in any orbit (closed or escape orbits) the velocity relative to the central body increases.", "Briefly burning the engine (an \u201cimpulsive burn\u201d) Prograde motion prograde at periapsis increases the velocity by the same increment as at any other time (delta-v ).", "However, since the vehicle's kinetic energy is related to the ''square'' of its velocity, this increase in velocity has a non-linear effect on the vehicle's kinetic energy, leaving it with higher energy than if the burn were achieved at any other time.", "If an impulsive burn of delta-v \u0394''v'' is performed at periapsis in a Parabolic trajectory parabolic orbit, then the velocity at periapsis before the burn is equal to the escape velocity (''V''<sub>esc</sub>), and the specific kinetic energy after the burn is\n: \nwhere .", "When the vehicle leaves the gravity field, the loss of specific kinetic energy is\n: \nso it retains the energy\n: \nwhich is larger than the energy from a burn outside the gravitational field () by\n: \nWhen the vehicle has left the gravity well, it is travelling at a speed\n: \nFor the case where the added impulse  \u0394''v'' is small compared to escape velocity, the 1 can be ignored, and the effective \u0394''v'' of the impulsive burn can be seen to be multiplied by a factor of simply\n: \nSimilar effects happen in closed and hyperbolic trajectory hyperbolic orbits.", "If the vehicle travels at velocity ''v'' at the start of a burn that changes the velocity by \u0394''v'', then the change in specific orbital energy (SOE) due to the new orbit is\n: \nOnce the spacecraft is far from the planet again, the SOE is entirely kinetic, since gravitational potential energy approaches zero.", "Therefore, the larger the ''v'' at the time of the burn, the greater the final kinetic energy, and the higher the final velocity.", "The effect becomes more pronounced the closer to the central body, or more generally, the deeper in the gravitational field potential in which the burn occurs, since the velocity is higher there.", "So if a spacecraft is on a parabolic trajectory parabolic flyby of Jupiter with a periapsis velocity of 50&nbsp;km/s and performs a 5&nbsp;km/s burn, it turns out that the final velocity change at great distance is 22.9&nbsp;km/s, giving a multiplication of the burn by 4.58 times.", "It may seem that the rocket is getting energy for free, which would violate conservation of energy.", "However, any gain to the rocket's kinetic energy is balanced by a relative decrease in the kinetic energy the exhaust is left with (the kinetic energy of the exhaust may still increase, but it does not increase as much).<ref name=ways/> Contrast this to the situation of static firing, where the speed of the engine is fixed at zero.", "This means that its kinetic energy does not increase at all, and all the chemical energy released by the fuel is converted to the exhaust's kinetic energy (and heat).", "At very high speeds the mechanical power imparted to the rocket can exceed the total power liberated in the combustion of the propellant; this may also seem to violate conservation of energy.", "But the propellants in a fast-moving rocket carry energy not only chemically, but also in their own kinetic energy, which at speeds above a few kilometres per second exceed the chemical component.", "When these propellants are burned, some of this kinetic energy is transferred to the rocket along with the chemical energy released by burning.", "The Oberth effect can therefore partly make up for what is extremely low efficiency early in the rocket's flight when it is moving only slowly.", "Most of the work done by a rocket early in flight is \"invested\" in the kinetic energy of the propellant not yet burned, part of which they will release later when they are burned.", "<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order & add a

aerodynamics airflow over the wing at high angle of attack angles of attack, so delaying the stall and consequent loss of lift.", "In cruising flight the effect of the LERX is minimal.", "However at high angles of attack, as often encountered in a dog fight or during takeoff and landing, the LERX generates a high-speed vortex that attaches to the top of the wing.", "The vortex action maintains a smooth airflow over the wing surface well past the normal stall (flight) stall point at which the airflow would otherwise break up, thus sustaining lift at very high angles.", "LERX were first used on

high Earth orbit to Mars of about Delta-v budget#Delta-vs between Earth, Moon and Mars 4000m/s).", "It might be thought that adding power generation capacity is helpful, and although initially this can improve performance, this inevitably increases the weight of the power source, and eventually the mass of the power source and the associated engines and propellant dominates the weight of the vehicle, and then adding more power gives no significant improvement.", "For, although solar energy solar power and nuclear power are virtually unlimited sources of ''energy'', the maximum ''power'' they can supply is substantially proportional to the mass of the powerplant (i.e.", "power-to-weight ratio specific power takes a largely constant value which is dependent on the particular powerplant

etc.).", "The energy required can simply be computed as\n:\nThis corresponds to the kinetic energy the expelled reaction mass would have at a speed equal to the exhaust speed.", "If the reaction mass had to be accelerated from zero speed to the exhaust speed, all energy produced would go into the reaction mass and nothing would be left for kinetic energy gain by the rocket and payload.", "However, if the rocket already moves and accelerates (the reaction mass is expelled in the direction opposite to the direction in which the rocket moves) less kinetic energy is added to the reaction mass.", "To see this, if, for example, =10&nbsp;km/s and the speed of the rocket is 3&nbsp;km/s, then the speed of a small amount of expended reaction mass changes from 3&nbsp;km/s forwards to 7&nbsp;km/s rearwards.", "Thus, although the energy required is 50 MJ per kg reaction mass, only 20 MJ is used for the increase in speed of the reaction mass.", "The remaining 30 MJ is the increase of the kinetic energy of the rocket and payload.", "In general:\n:\nThus the specific energy gain of the rocket in any small time interval is the energy gain of the rocket including the remaining fuel, divided by its mass, where the energy gain is equal to the energy produced by the fuel minus the energy gain of the reaction mass.", "The larger the speed of the rocket, the smaller the energy gain of the

a fixed exhaust speed.", "Due to the Oberth effect and starting from a nonzero speed, the required potential energy needed from the propellant may be ''less'' than the increase in energy in the

longitudinally.", "For helicopters with a single main rotor, the CG is usually close to the main rotor mast.", "Improper balance of a helicopter's load can result in serious control problems.", "In addition to making a helicopter difficult to control, an out-of-balance loading condition also decreases maneuverability since cyclic control is less effective in the direction opposite to the CG location.", "The pilot tries to perfectly balance a helicopter so that the fuselage remains horizontal in hovering flight, with no cyclic pitch control needed except for wind correction.", "Since the fuselage acts as a pendulum suspended from the rotor, changing the center of gravity changes the angle at which the aircraft hangs from the rotor.", "When the center of gravity is directly under the

forward CG may occur when a heavy pilot and passenger take off without baggage or proper ballast located aft of the rotor mast.", "This situation becomes worse if the fuel tanks are located aft of the

and the resulting autorotation, the pilot may not have enough cyclic control to flare properly for the landing.", "A forward CG will not be as obvious when hovering into a strong wind, since less rearward cyclic displacement is required than when hovering with no wind.", "When determining whether a critical balance condition exists, it is essential to consider the wind velocity and its

combination of baggage and substantial fuel where both are aft of the rotor mast.", "An aft CG condition can be recognized by the pilot when coming to a hover following a vertical takeoff.", "The helicopter will have a tail-low attitude, and the pilot will need excessive forward displacement of cyclic control to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition.", "If there is a wind, the pilot needs even greater forward cyclic.", "If flight is continued in this condition, the pilot may find it impossible to fly in the upper allowable airspeed range due to inadequate forward cyclic authority to maintain a nose-low attitude.", "In addition, with an extreme aft CG, gusty or rough air could accelerate the helicopter to a speed faster than that produced with full forward cyclic control.", "In this case, dissymmetry of lift and blade flapping could cause the rotor disc to tilt aft.", "With full forward cyclic control already applied, the rotor disc might not be able to be lowered, resulting in possible loss of control, or the rotor blades striking the tail boom.", "In fixed-wing aircraft, lateral balance is often much less critical than fore-aft balance, simply because most mass in the aircraft is located very close to its center.", "An exception is fuel, which may be loaded into the wings, but since fuel loads are usually symmetrical about the axis of the aircraft, lateral balance is not usually affected.", "The lateral center of gravity may become important if the fuel is not loaded evenly into tanks on both sides of the aircraft, or (in the case of small aircraft) when passengers are predominantly on one side of the aircraft (such as a pilot flying alone in a small aircraft).", "Small lateral deviations of CG that are within limits may cause an annoying roll tendency that pilots must compensate for, but they are not dangerous as long as the CG remains within limits for the duration of the flight.", "For most helicopters, it is usually not necessary to determine the lateral CG for normal flight instruction and passenger flights.", "This is because helicopter cabins are relatively narrow and most optional equipment is located near the center line.", "However, some helicopter manuals specify the seat from which solo flight must be conducted.", "In addition, if there is an unusual situation, such as a heavy pilot and a full load of fuel on one side of the helicopter, which could affect the lateral CG, its position should be checked against the CG envelope.", "If carrying external loads in a position that requires large lateral cyclic control displacement to maintain level flight, fore and aft cyclic effectiveness could be dramatically limited.", "Many large transport-category aircraft are able to take-off at a greater weight than they can land.", "This is possible because the weight of fuel that the wings can support along their span in flight, or when parked or taxiing on the ground, is greater than they can tolerate during the stress of landing and touchdown, when the support is not distributed along the span of the wing.", "Normally the portion of the aircraft's weight that exceeds the maximum landing weight (but falls within the maximum take-off weight) is entirely composed of fuel.", "As the aircraft flies, the fuel burns off, and by the time the aircraft is ready to land, it is below its maximum landing weight.", "However, if an aircraft must land early, sometimes the fuel that remains aboard still keeps the aircraft over the maximum landing weight.", "When this happens, the aircraft must either burn off the fuel (by flying in a holding pattern) or dump it (if the aircraft is equipped to do this) before landing to avoid damage to the aircraft.", "In an emergency, an aircraft may choose to land overweight, but this may damage it, and at the very least an overweight landing will mandate a thorough inspection to check for any damage.", "In some cases, an aircraft may take off overweight deliberately.", "An example might be an aircraft being ferried over a very long distance with extra fuel aboard.", "An overweight take-off typically requires an exceptionally long runway.", "Overweight operations are not

by a pair of Marx generators built by Maxwell Laboratories of San Diego, California.", "The generators were mounted on pedestals constructed of wood in the same manner as the main test platform, one on each side of a large wedge shaped steel structure which acted as a ground plane for the horizontally polarized pulse.", "Each Marx generator consisted of a stack of 50 trays, each containing two large capacitors and a plasma switch.", "A large peaking capacitor, used to adjust the shape of the resulting pulse, was also part of the design.", "Each generator was enclosed in a large fiberglass structure which was filled with SF6 sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) acting as an insulating gas.", "The tray capacitors were slowly charged such that each tray had up to 100kV of potential.", "When discharged through the plasma switches, the 50 trays in series could (ideally) produce up to 5 megavolts of electrical potential in a pulse with a rise-time in the 100 nanosecond range.", "The generators on either side of the wedge were charged to opposite polarities and fired into twin transmission lines (antennas) mounted on either side of the test platform.", "When triggered simultaneously the resulting EM waves from each generator combined at the sharp point of the wedge building, adding to a total electrical potential of 10 mega- megavolts.<ref name=\"reuben\"/>  The transmission lines were terminated into a 50 ohm low inductance resistive load mounted on a tall wooden tower at the far end of the platform.", "The result was a fast 200 gigawatt pulse of electromagnetic flux powerful enough to reliably reproduce (at short range) the deleterious effects of a thermonuclear explosion thermonuclear detonation on electronic circuitry as created by such examples as the Hardtack I HARDTACK I, Operation Argus ARGUS and Operation Dominic I and II DOMINIC I (Operation Fishbowl) high altitude nuclear tests.", "Due to their higher flight altitude and nuclear payload, Strategic Air Command bombers were the primary object of the tests, but fighters, transport aircraft and even missiles were also tested for EMP hardness on Trestle.", "In addition to electronics survivability tests, numerous sensors located inside, beneath and to the sides of the aircraft would gather additional data on the airframe's EMP permeability to be used in design considerations for future Cold War aircraft and to identify areas which needed additional EM hardening.", "The advances made in EMP generation technology by Sandia during the operation of Trestle greatly assisted in the construction of the much more powerful 40 megavolt, 50 terawatt (50,000 gigawatt) Z Pulsed Power Facility Z Machine at Sandia during the 1990s.", "Technological advances during the 2000s have since boosted this output to 290 terawatts (290,000 gigawatts), high enough to actually study nuclear fusion at the point of detonation.", "The primary wooden structure of Trestle was 1,000 feet long, 125 feet (about 12 stories) tall, and constructed of 6.5 million board-feet of lumber, sufficient to support a fully loaded B-52 (then the largest and heaviest strategic bomber in the US inventory) while also minimizing any chance of interference from the ground or the structure itself, creating a reasonable simulation of airborne conditions.", "A mix of Douglas Fir and Southern Yellow Pine were used for the timbers,<ref name=\"reuben\"/> as both showed excellent EMP transparency with the former having the best tensile strength and the latter the best weather resistance.", "By using an all glued laminated timber structure and woodworking joints to mate the giant timbers, with the joints being held together with wooden bolts and nuts, measurements from the EMP tests would not be skewed by large amounts of ferrous material in the structure.", "Some metal was used in the construction as critically loaded joints incorporated a circular steel sheer ring that surrounded the wooden bolt clamping the joint.", "Even the fire escape along one side of the trestle and the whole of the extensive fire suppression piping were constructed of fiberglass.", "The wedge shaped structure was of steel I-beam construction.", "The entire structure was covered with a wire mesh similar to livestock fencing in order to create an enormous Faraday cage.", "A multistory building was constructed inside the wedge which served as offices, laboratories and testing facilities.", "The second floor of the building housed a large electromagnetically shielded room, supplied by Electromagnetic Filter Company of Palo Alto, California, which contained the data acquisition electronics, the Marx generator charging and firing control and field strength monitoring instrumentation.", "The data acquisition system consisted of a large number of state-of-the-art Tektronix 7912AD digitizers along with a large array of DEC PDP-11 computers.", "The pulse monitoring instrumentation consisted of a number of B dot and H field sensors mounted on the exterior of the wedge connected to oscilloscopes fitted with Polaroid o'scope cameras needed to capture the transient pulse data.", "The open-air third floor held large inflatable gas bags which could store the SF6 sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) gas from the Marx generator enclosures when they needed to be opened for maintenance.", "The ATLAS-I program was shut down after the end of the Cold War in 1991, which brought an end to destructive testing destructive EMP testing of aircraft, being replaced by far cheaper computer simulations as technology improved.", "Despite going without maintenance 20 years, the wooden trestle structures were all still standing in 2011, and the structure remained the biggest metal-free wood laminate structure in the world.<ref name=\"reuben\"/> The trestle had, however, become a significant fire hazard since the pentachlorophenol-isobutane-ether treated wood had dried considerably in the desert conditions and the automatic fire sprinkler system had been deactivated in 1991.", "Efforts were underway to secure the funding necessary to have the structure protected as a national historic landmark, although efforts are complicated by the top secret nature of the Sandia/Kirtland facility it is situated on.", "The trestle structure is still easily visible

resistance to bending stresses was carried in the two top and bottom flanges of the girder, with the central web only carrying out a spacing function.", "The central web could thus be drilled indiscriminately, supposedly without weakening the overall girder.", "This was based on two fallacies: firstly that the only forces on the beam were simple bending forces in the plane of the web.", "In practice, a more complicated force, such as an unexpected torsional twisting from a sudden suspension bump overloaded the now-weakened central web and the lightened beam failed immediately.", "Secondly, the assumption that the ideal forces were separated into the top and bottom flanges was increasingly unrealistic with the development of stressed skin and monocoque designs, where loads

over-expanded (a shock wave forms inside the nozzle extension).", "In practice, perfect expansion is only achievable with a variable-exit area nozzle (since ambient pressure decreases as altitude increases), and is not possible above a certain altitude as ambient pressure approaches zero.", "If the nozzle is not perfectly expanded, then loss of efficiency occurs.", "Grossly over-expanded nozzles lose less efficiency, but can cause mechanical problems with the nozzle.", "Fixed-area nozzles become progressively more under-expanded as they gain altitude.", "Almost all de Laval nozzles will be momentarily grossly over-expanded during startup in an atmosphere.", "Nozzle efficiency is affected by operation in the atmosphere because atmospheric pressure changes with altitude; but due to the supersonic speeds of the gas exiting from a rocket engine, the pressure of the jet may be either below or above ambient, and equilibrium between the two is not reached at all altitudes (see diagram).", "For optimal performance, the pressure of the gas at the end of the nozzle should just equal the ambient pressure: if the exhaust's pressure is lower than the ambient pressure, then the vehicle will be slowed by the difference in pressure between the top of the engine and the exit; on the other hand, if the exhaust's pressure is higher, then exhaust pressure that could have been converted into thrust is not converted, and energy is wasted.", "To maintain this ideal of equality between the exhaust's exit pressure and the ambient pressure, the diameter of the nozzle would need to increase with altitude, giving the pressure a longer nozzle to act on (and reducing the exit pressure and temperature).", "This increase is difficult to arrange in a lightweight fashion, although is routinely done with other forms of jet engines.", "In rocketry a lightweight compromise nozzle is generally used and some reduction in atmospheric performance occurs when used at other than the 'design altitude' or when throttled.", "To improve on this, various exotic nozzle designs such as the plug nozzle, stepped nozzles, the expanding nozzle and the aerospike engine aerospike have been proposed, each providing some way to adapt to changing ambient air pressure and each allowing the gas to expand further against the nozzle, giving extra thrust at higher altitudes.", "When exhausting

be uniform around the axis of the engine, a side force may be imparted to the engine.", "This side force may change over time and result in control problems with the launch vehicle.", "Advanced altitude compensating nozzle altitude-compensating designs, such as the aerospike engine aerospike or plug nozzle, attempt to minimize performance losses by adjusting to varying expansion ratio caused by changing altitude.", "Image:Nozzle de Laval diagram.svg thumb right upright Typical temperature (T), pressure (p), and velocity (v) profiles in a de Laval Nozzle\nFor a rocket engine to be propellant efficient, it is important that the maximum pressures possible be created on the walls of the chamber and nozzle by a specific amount of propellant; as this is the source of the thrust.", "This can be achieved by all of:\n*heating the propellant to as high a temperature as possible (using a high energy fuel, containing hydrogen and carbon and sometimes metals such as aluminium, or even using nuclear energy)\n*using a low specific density gas (as hydrogen rich as possible)\n*using propellants which are, or decompose to, simple molecules with few degrees of freedom to maximise translational velocity\nSince all of these things minimise the mass of the propellant used, and since pressure is proportional to the mass of propellant present to be accelerated as it pushes on the engine, and since from Newton's third law the pressure that acts on the engine also reciprocally acts on the propellant, it turns out that for any given engine, the speed that the propellant leaves the chamber is unaffected by the chamber pressure (although the thrust is proportional).", "However, speed is significantly affected by all three of the above factors and the exhaust speed is an excellent measure of the engine propellant efficiency.", "This is termed ''exhaust velocity'', and after allowance is made for factors that can reduce it, the effective exhaust velocity is one of the most important parameters of a rocket engine (although weight, cost, ease of manufacture etc.", "are usually also very important).", "For aerodynamic reasons the flow goes sonic (\"Choked flow chokes\") at the narrowest part of the nozzle, the 'throat'.", "Since the speed of sound in gases increases with the square root of temperature, the use of hot exhaust gas greatly improves performance.", "By comparison, at room temperature the speed of sound in air is about 340&nbsp;m/s while the speed of sound in the hot gas of a rocket engine can be over 1700&nbsp;m/s; much of this performance is due to the higher temperature, but additionally rocket propellants are chosen to be of low molecular mass, and this also gives a higher velocity compared to air.", "Expansion in the rocket nozzle then further multiplies the speed, typically between 1.5 and 2 times, giving a highly collimated hypersonic exhaust jet.", "The speed increase of a rocket nozzle is mostly determined by its area expansion ratio\u2014the ratio of the area of the throat to the area at the exit, but detailed properties of the gas are also important.", "Larger ratio nozzles are more massive but are able to extract more heat from the combustion gases, increasing the exhaust velocity.", "Vehicles typically require the overall thrust to change direction over the length of the burn.", "A number of different ways to achieve this have been flown:\n*The entire engine is mounted on a hinge or gimbal and any propellant feeds reach the engine via low pressure flexible pipes or rotary couplings.", "*Just the combustion chamber and nozzle is gimballed, the pumps are fixed, and high pressure feeds attach to the engine.", "*Multiple engines (often canted at slight angles) are deployed but throttled to give the overall vector that is required, giving only a very small penalty.", "*High-temperature vanes protrude into the exhaust and can be tilted to deflect the jet.", "Rocket technology can combine very high thrust (meganewtons), very high exhaust speeds (around 10 times the speed of sound in air at sea level) and very high thrust/weight ratios (>100) ''simultaneously'' as well as being able to operate outside the atmosphere, and while permitting the use of low pressure and hence lightweight tanks and structure.", "Rockets can be further optimised to even more extreme performance along one or more of these axes at the expense of the others.", "The most important metric for the efficiency of a rocket engine is impulse (physics) impulse per unit of propellant, this is called specific impulse (usually written ).", "This is either measured as a speed (the ''effective exhaust velocity''  in metres/second or ft/s) or as a time (seconds).", "For example, if an engine producing 100 pounds of thrust runs for 320 seconds and burns 100 pounds of propellant, then the specific impulse is 320 seconds.", "The higher the specific impulse, the less propellant is required to provide the desired impulse.", "The specific impulse that can be achieved is primarily a function of the propellant mix (and ultimately would limit the specific impulse), but practical limits on chamber pressures and the nozzle expansion ratios reduce the performance that can be achieved.", "Below is an approximate equation for calculating the net thrust of a rocket engine:\n:\n:{

a conventional rocket motor lacks an air intake, there is no 'ram drag' to deduct from the gross thrust.", "Consequently, the net thrust of a rocket motor is equal to the gross thrust (apart from static back pressure).", "The  term represents the momentum thrust, which remains constant at a given throttle setting, whereas the  term represents the pressure thrust term.", "At full throttle, the net thrust of a rocket motor improves slightly with increasing altitude, because as atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, the pressure thrust term increases.", "At the surface of the Earth the pressure thrust may be reduced by up to 30%, depending on the engine design.", "This reduction drops roughly exponentially to zero with increasing altitude.", "Maximum efficiency for a rocket engine is achieved by maximising the momentum contribution of the equation without incurring penalties from over expanding the exhaust.", "This occurs when .", "Since ambient pressure changes with altitude, most rocket engines spend very little time operating at peak efficiency.", "Since specific impulse is force divided by the rate of mass flow, this equation means that the specific impulse varies with altitude.", "Due to the specific impulse varying with pressure, a quantity that is easy to compare and calculate with is useful.", "Because rockets choked flow choke at the throat, and because the supersonic exhaust prevents external pressure influences travelling upstream, it turns out that the pressure at the exit is ideally exactly proportional to the propellant flow , provided the mixture ratios and combustion efficiencies are maintained.", "It is thus quite usual to rearrange the above equation slightly:\n:\nand so define the ''vacuum Isp'' to be:\n:\nwhere:\n: &nbsp;  &thinsp;= &thinsp;the speed of sound constant at the throat\n: &thinsp;= &thinsp;the thrust coefficient constant of the nozzle (typically about 2)\nAnd hence:\n:\nRockets can be throttled by controlling the propellant combustion rate  (usually measured in kg/s or lb/s).", "In liquid and hybrid rockets, the propellant flow entering the chamber is controlled using valves, in solid rockets it is controlled by changing the area of propellant that is burning and this can be designed into the propellant grain (and hence cannot be controlled in real-time).", "Rockets can usually be throttled down to an exit pressure of about one-third of ambient pressure<ref name=Sutton/> (often limited by flow separation in nozzles) and up to a maximum limit determined only by the mechanical strength of the engine.", "In practice, the degree to which rockets can be throttled varies greatly, but most rockets can be throttled by a factor of 2 without great difficulty;<ref name=Sutton/> the typical limitation is combustion stability, as for example, injectors need a minimum pressure to avoid triggering damaging oscillations (chugging or combustion instabilities); but injectors can be optimised and tested for wider ranges.", "For example, some more recent liquid-propellant engine designs that have been optimised for greater throttling capability (BE-3, Raptor (rocket engine) Raptor) can be throttled to as low as 18\u201320 percent of rated thrust.<!-- eg, Blue Orgin BE-3 --><ref name=sn20150407>\n</ref><!-- eg, SpaceX Raptor --><ref name=sfi20160927>\n</ref>\nSolid rockets can be throttled by using shaped grains that will vary their surface area over the course of the burn.<ref name=Sutton/>\nRocket engine nozzles are surprisingly efficient heat engines for generating a high speed jet, as a consequence of the high combustion temperature and high compression ratio.", "Rocket nozzles give an excellent approximation to adiabatic expansion which is a reversible process, and hence they give efficiencies which are very close to that of the Carnot cycle.", "Given the temperatures reached, over 60% efficiency can be achieved with chemical rockets.", "For a ''vehicle'' employing a rocket engine the energetic efficiency is very good if the vehicle speed approaches or somewhat exceeds the exhaust velocity (relative to launch); but at low speeds the energy efficiency goes to 0% at zero speed (as with all jet propulsion.)", "<!--- it's very counterintuitive, a way to look at it is that energy= force x distance, but at zero speed you have no movement and you lose lots of energy in the jet --->See Rocket#Energy efficiency Rocket energy efficiency for more details.", "Rockets, of all the jet engines, indeed of essentially all engines, have the highest thrust to weight ratio.", "This is especially true for liquid rocket engines.", "This high performance is due to the small volume of pressure vessels that make up the engine\u2014the pumps, pipes and combustion chambers involved.", "The lack of inlet duct and the use of dense liquid propellant allows the pressurisation system to be small and lightweight, whereas duct engines have to deal with air which has around three orders of magnitude lower density.", "Of the liquid propellants used, density is lowest for liquid hydrogen.", "Although this propellant has the highest specific impulse, its very low density (about one fourteenth that of water) requires larger and heavier turbopumps and pipework, which decreases the engine's thrust-to-weight ratio (for example the RS-25) compared to those that do not (NK-33).", "For efficiency reasons, higher temperatures are desirable, but materials lose their strength if the temperature becomes too high.", "Rockets run with combustion temperatures that can reach ~3,500 K (~3,200&nbsp;\u00b0C or ~5,800&nbsp;\u00b0F).", "Most other jet engines have gas turbines in the hot exhaust.", "Due to their larger surface area, they are harder to cool and hence there is a need to run the combustion processes at much lower temperatures, losing efficiency.", "In addition, wiktionary:duct engine duct engines use air as an oxidant, which contains 78% largely unreactive nitrogen, which dilutes the reaction and lowers the temperatures.<ref name=Sutton/> Rockets have none of these inherent combustion temperature limiters.", "The temperatures reached by rocket exhaust often substantially exceed the melting points of the nozzle and combustion chamber materials (~1,200 K for copper).", "Most construction materials will also combust if exposed to high temperature oxidizer, which leads to a number of design challenges.", "The nozzle and combustion temperature walls must not be allowed to combust, melt, or vaporize (sometimes facetiously termed an \"engine-rich exhaust\").", "Rockets that use the common construction materials such as aluminium, steel, nickel or copper alloys must employ cooling systems to limit the temperatures that engine structures experience.", "Regenerative cooling (rocket) Regenerative cooling, where the propellant is passed through tubes around the combustion chamber or nozzle, and other techniques, such as curtain cooling or film cooling, are employed to give longer nozzle and chamber life.", "These techniques ensure that a gaseous thermal boundary layer touching the material is kept below the temperature which would cause the material to catastrophically fail.", "Two material exceptions that can directly sustain rocket exhaust temperatures are graphite and tungsten, although both are subject to oxidation if not protected.", "Materials technology, combined with the engine design, is a limiting factor of the exhaust temperature of chemical rockets.", "In rockets, the heat fluxes that can pass through the wall are among the highest in engineering; fluxes are generally in the range of 1-200 MW/m<sup>2</sup>.", "The strongest heat fluxes are found at the throat, which often sees twice that found in the associated chamber and nozzle.", "This is due to the combination of high speeds (which gives a very thin boundary layer), and although lower than the chamber, the high temperatures seen there.", "(See #Rocket nozzles rocket nozzles above for temperatures in nozzle).", "In rockets the coolant methods include:\n#uncooled (used for short runs mainly during testing)\n#ablation ablative walls (walls are lined with a material that is continuously vaporised and carried away).", "#radiative cooling (the chamber becomes almost white hot and radiates the heat away)\n#dump cooling (a propellant, usually hydrogen, is passed around the chamber and dumped)\n#regenerative cooling (rocket) regenerative cooling (liquid rockets use the fuel, or occasionally the oxidiser, to cool the chamber via a cooling jacket before being injected)\n#curtain cooling (propellant injection is arranged so the temperature of the gases is cooler at the walls)\n#film cooling (surfaces are wetted with liquid propellant, which cools as it evaporates)\nIn all cases the cooling effect that prevents the wall from being destroyed is caused by a thin layer of insulating fluid (a boundary layer) that is in contact with the walls that is far cooler than the combustion temperature.", "Provided this boundary layer is intact the wall will not be damaged.", "Disruption of the boundary layer may occur during cooling failures or combustion instabilities, and wall failure typically occurs soon after.", "With regenerative cooling a second boundary layer is found in the coolant channels around the chamber.", "This boundary layer thickness needs to be as small as possible, since the boundary layer acts as an insulator between the wall and the coolant.", "This may be achieved by making the coolant velocity in the channels as high as possible.", "In practice, regenerative cooling is nearly always used in conjunction with curtain cooling and/or film cooling.", "Liquid-fuelled engines are often run Air-fuel ratio fuel-rich, which lowers combustion temperatures.", "This reduces heat loads on the engine and allows lower cost materials and a simplified cooling system.", "This can also ''increase'' performance by lowering the average molecular weight of the exhaust and increasing the efficiency with which combustion heat is converted to kinetic exhaust energy.", "Rocket combustion chambers are normally operated at fairly high pressure, typically 10\u2013200bar (1\u201320MPa, 150\u20133,000psi).", "When operated within significant atmospheric pressure, higher combustion chamber pressures give better performance by permitting a larger and more efficient nozzle to be fitted without it being grossly overexpanded.", "However, these high pressures cause the outermost part of the chamber to be under very large hoop stresses \u2013 rocket engines are pressure vessels.", "Worse, due to the high temperatures created in rocket engines the materials used tend to have a significantly lowered working tensile strength.", "In addition, significant temperature gradients are set up in the walls of the chamber and nozzle, these cause differential expansion of the inner liner that create internal stresses.", "The extreme vibration and acoustic environment inside a rocket motor commonly result in peak stresses well above mean values, especially in the presence of organ pipe-like resonances and gas turbulence.", "The combustion may display undesired instabilities, of sudden or periodic nature.", "The pressure in the injection chamber may increase until the propellant flow through the injector plate decreases; a moment later the pressure drops and the flow increases, injecting more propellant in the combustion chamber which burns a moment later, and again increases the chamber pressure, repeating the cycle.", "This may lead to high-amplitude pressure oscillations, often in ultrasonic range, which may damage the motor.", "Oscillations of \u00b1200&nbsp;psi at 25&nbsp;kHz were the cause of failures of early versions of the LGM-25C Titan II Titan II missile second stage engines.", "The other failure mode is a deflagration to detonation transition; the supersonic Longitudinal wave pressure wave formed in the combustion chamber may destroy the engine.", "Combustion instability was also a problem during SM-65 Atlas Atlas development.", "The Rocketdyne engines used in the Atlas family were found to suffer from this effect in several static firing tests, and three missile launches exploded on the pad due to rough combustion in the booster engines.", "In most cases, it occurred while attempting to start the engines with a \"dry start\" method whereby the igniter mechanism would be activated prior to propellant injection.", "During the process of man-rating Atlas for Project Mercury, solving combustion instability was a high priority, and the final two Mercury flights sported an upgraded propulsion system with baffled injectors and a hypergolic igniter.", "The problem affecting Atlas vehicles was mainly the so-called \"racetrack\" phenomenon, where burning propellant would swirl around in a circle at faster and faster speeds, eventually producing vibration strong enough to rupture the engine, leading to complete destruction of the rocket.", "It was eventually solved by adding several baffles around the injector face to break up swirling propellant.", "More significantly, combustion instability was a problem with the Saturn F-1 engines.", "Some of the early units tested exploded during static firing, which led to the addition of injector baffles.", "In the Soviet space program, combustion instability also proved a problem on some rocket engines, including the RD-107 engine used in the R-7 family and the RD-216 used in the R-14 family, and several failures of these vehicles occurred before the problem was solved.", "Soviet engineering and manufacturing processes never satisfactorily resolved combustion instability in larger RP-1/LOX engines, so the RD-171 engine used to power the Zenit family still used four smaller thrust chambers fed by a common engine mechanism.", "The combustion instabilities can be provoked by remains of cleaning solvents in the engine (e.g.", "the first attempted launch of a Titan II in 1962), reflected shock wave, initial instability after ignition, explosion near the nozzle that reflects into the combustion chamber, and many more factors.", "In stable engine designs the oscillations are quickly suppressed; in unstable designs they persist for prolonged periods.", "Oscillation suppressors are commonly used.", "Periodic variations of thrust, caused by combustion instability or longitudinal vibrations of structures between the tanks and the engines which modulate the propellant flow, are known as \"pogo oscillations\" or \"pogo\", named after the pogo stick.", "Three different types of combustion instabilities occur:\nThis is a low frequency oscillation at a few Hertz in chamber pressure usually caused by pressure variations in feed lines due to variations in acceleration of the vehicle.<ref name=sutton1975/> \nThis can cause cyclic variation in thrust, and the effects can vary from merely annoying to actually damaging the payload or vehicle.", "Chugging can be minimised by using gas-filled damping tubes on feed lines of high density propellants.", "This can be caused due to insufficient pressure drop across the injectors.<ref name=sutton1975/> \nIt generally is mostly annoying, rather than being damaging.", "However, in extreme cases combustion can end up being forced backwards through the injectors \u2013 this can cause explosions with monopropellants.", "This is the most immediately damaging, and the hardest to control.", "It is due to acoustics within the combustion chamber that often couples to the chemical combustion processes that are the primary drivers of the energy release, and can lead to unstable resonant \"screeching\" that commonly leads to catastrophic failure due to thinning of the insulating thermal boundary layer.", "Acoustic oscillations can be excited by thermal processes, such as the flow of hot air through a pipe or combustion in a chamber.", "Specifically, standing acoustic waves inside a chamber can be intensified if combustion occurs more intensely in regions where the pressure of the acoustic wave is maximal.<ref name=strutt1896>\n According to Lord Rayleigh's criterion for thermoacoustic processes, \"If heat be given to the air at the moment of greatest condensation, or be taken from it at the

vibration is discouraged.", "\"</ref><ref name=sutton1975>\n See Chapter 8, Section 6 and especially Section 7, re combustion instability.</ref> \nSuch effects are very difficult to predict analytically during the design process, and have usually been addressed by expensive, time consuming and extensive testing, combined with trial and error remedial correction measures.", "Screeching is often dealt with by detailed changes to injectors, or changes in the propellant chemistry, or vaporising the propellant before injection, or use of Helmholtz dampers within the combustion chambers to change the resonant modes of the chamber.", "Testing for the possibility of screeching is sometimes done by exploding small explosive charges outside the combustion chamber with a tube set tangentially to the combustion chamber near the injectors to determine the engine's impulse response and then evaluating the time response of the chamber pressure- a fast recovery indicates a stable system.", "For all but the very smallest sizes, rocket exhaust compared to other engines is generally very noisy.", "As the hypersonic exhaust mixes with the ambient air, shock waves are formed.", "The Space Shuttle generates over 200 dB(A) of noise around its base.", "To reduce this, and the risk of payload damage or injury to the crew atop the stack, the mobile launcher platform was fitted with a Sound Suppression System that sprayed  of water around the base of the rocket in 41 seconds at launch time.", "Using this system kept sound levels within the payload bay to 142&nbsp;dB

shock waves generated depends on the size of the rocket and on the exhaust velocity.", "Such shock waves seem to account for the characteristic crackling and popping sounds produced by large rocket engines when heard live.", "These noise peaks typically overload microphones and audio electronics, and so are generally weakened or entirely absent in recorded or broadcast audio reproductions.", "For large rockets at close range, the acoustic effects could actually kill.", "More worryingly for space agencies, such sound levels can also damage the launch structure, or worse, be reflected back at the comparatively delicate rocket above.", "This is why so much water is typically used at launches.", "The water spray changes the acoustic qualities of the air and reduces or deflects the sound energy away from the rocket.", "Generally speaking, noise is most intense when a rocket is close to the ground, since the noise from the engines radiates up away from the jet, as well as reflecting off the ground.", "Also, when the vehicle is moving slowly, little of the chemical energy input to the engine can go into increasing the kinetic energy of the rocket (since useful power ''P'' transmitted to the vehicle is  for thrust ''F'' and speed ''V'').", "Then the largest portion of the energy is dissipated in the exhaust's interaction with the ambient air, producing noise.", "This noise can be reduced somewhat by flame trenches with roofs, by water injection around the jet and by deflecting the jet at an angle.", "Rocket engines are usually statically tested at a rocket engine test facility test facility before being put into production.", "For high altitude engines, either a shorter nozzle must be used, or the rocket must be tested in a large vacuum chamber.", "Rocket vehicles have a reputation for unreliability and danger; especially catastrophic failures.", "Contrary to this reputation, carefully designed rockets can be made arbitrarily reliable.", "In military use, rockets are not unreliable.", "However, one of the main non-military uses of rockets is for orbital launch.", "In this application, the premium has typically been placed on minimum weight, and it is difficult to achieve high reliability and low weight simultaneously.", "In addition, if the number of flights launched is low, there is a very high chance of a design, operations or manufacturing error causing destruction of the vehicle.", "The Rocketdyne H-1 engine, used in a cluster of eight in the first stage of the Saturn I and Saturn IB launch vehicles, had no catastrophic failures in 152 engine-flights.", "The Pratt and Whitney RL10 engine, used in a cluster of six in the Saturn I second stage, had no catastrophic failures in 36 engine-flights.", "The Rocketdyne F-1 engine, used in a

notable catastrophic failure in 270 engine-flights.", "The RS-25, used in a cluster of three, flew in 46 refurbished engine units.", "These made a total of 405 engine-flights with no catastrophic in-flight failures.", "A single in-flight RS-25 engine failure occurred during 's STS-51-F mission.", "This failure had no effect on mission objectives or duration.", "Rocket propellants require a high energy per unit mass (specific energy), which must be balanced against the tendency of highly energetic propellants to spontaneously explode.", "Assuming that the chemical potential energy of the propellants can be safely stored, the combustion process results in a great deal of heat being released.", "A significant fraction of this heat is transferred to kinetic energy in the engine nozzle, propelling the rocket forward in combination with the mass of combustion products released.", "Ideally all the reaction energy appears as kinetic energy of the exhaust gases, as exhaust velocity is the single most important performance parameter of an engine.", "However, real exhaust species are molecules, which typically have translation, vibrational, and rotational modes with which to dissipate energy.", "Of these, only translation can do useful work to the vehicle, and while energy does transfer between modes this process occurs on a timescale far in excess of the time required for the exhaust to leave the nozzle.", "The more chemical bonds an exhaust molecule has, the more rotational and vibrational modes it will have.", "Consequently, it is generally desirable for the exhaust species to be as simple as possible, with a diatomic molecule composed of light, abundant atoms such as H<sub>2</sub> being ideal in practical terms.", "However, in the case of a chemical rocket, hydrogen is a reactant and reducing agent, not a product.", "An oxidizing agent, most typically oxygen or an oxygen-rich species, must be introduced into the combustion process, adding mass and chemical bonds to the exhaust species.", "An additional advantage of light molecules is that they may be accelerated to high velocity at temperatures that can be contained by currently available materials - the high gas temperatures in rocket engines pose serious problems for the engineering of survivable motors.", "Liquid hydrogen (LH2) and oxygen (LOX, or LO2), are the most effective propellants in terms of exhaust velocity that have been widely used to date, though a few exotic combinations involving boron or liquid ozone are potentially somewhat better in theory if various practical problems could be solved.", "It is important to note that, when computing the specific reaction energy of a given propellant combination, the entire mass of the propellants (both fuel and oxidizer) must be included.", "The exception is in the case of air-breathing engines, which use atmospheric oxygen and consequently have to carry less mass for a given energy output.", "Fuels for car or turbojet engines have a much better effective energy output per unit mass of propellant that must be carried, but are similar per unit mass of fuel.", "Computer programs that predict the performance of propellants in rocket engines are available.", "With liquid and hybrid rockets, immediate ignition of the propellant(s) as they first enter the combustion chamber is essential.", "With liquid propellants (but not gaseous), failure to ignite within milliseconds usually causes too much liquid propellant to be inside the chamber, and if/when ignition occurs the amount of hot gas created can exceed the maximum design pressure of the chamber, causing a catastrophic failure of the pressure vessel.", "This is sometimes called a ''hard start'' or a ''rapid unscheduled disassembly'' (RUD).<ref name=aw20121126>\n</ref>\nIgnition can be achieved by a number of different methods; a pyrotechnic charge can be used, a plasma torch can be used, or electric spark ignition<ref name=nsf20161003>\n</ref> may be employed.", "Some fuel/oxidiser combinations ignite on contact (hypergolic), and non-hypergolic fuels can be \"chemically ignited\" by priming the fuel lines with hypergolic propellants (popular in Russian engines).", "Gaseous propellants generally will not cause hard starts, with rockets the total injector area is less than the throat thus the chamber pressure tends to ambient prior to ignition and high pressures cannot form even if the entire chamber is full of flammable gas at ignition.", "Solid propellants are usually ignited with one-shot pyrotechnic devices.<ref name=Sutton/>\nOnce ignited, rocket chambers are self-sustaining and igniters are not needed.", "Indeed, chambers often spontaneously reignite if they are restarted after being shut down for a few seconds.", "However, when cooled, many rockets cannot be restarted without at least minor maintenance, such as replacement of the pyrotechnic igniter.<ref

black-body radiation of the unburnt particles, in addition to the blue Swan bands.", "high test peroxide Peroxide oxidizer-based rockets and hydrogen rocket jets contain largely steam and are nearly invisible to the naked eye but shine brightly in the ultraviolet and infrared.", "Jets from solid rockets can be highly visible as the propellant frequently contains metals such as elemental aluminium which burns with an orange-white flame and adds energy to the combustion process.", "Some exhausts, notably alcohol fuelled rockets, can show visible shock diamonds.", "These are due to cyclic variations in the jet pressure relative to ambient creating shock waves that form 'Mach disks'.", "The shape of the jet varies by the design altitude: at high altitude all rockets are grossly

that uses two or more rocket ''stages'', each of which contains its own Rocket engine engines and Rocket propellant propellant.", "A ''tandem'' or ''serial'' stage is mounted on top of another stage; a ''parallel'' stage is attached alongside another stage.", "The result is effectively two or more rockets stacked on top of or attached next to each other.", "Two-stage rockets are quite common, but rockets with as many as five separate stages have been successfully launched.", "By jettisoning stages when they run out of propellant, the mass of the remaining rocket is decreased.", "Each successive stage can also be optimized for its specific operating conditions, such as decreased atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes.", "This ''staging'' allows the thrust of the remaining stages to Newton's First Law of Motion more easily accelerate the rocket to its final speed and height.", "In serial or tandem staging schemes, the first stage is at the bottom and is usually the largest, the second stage and subsequent upper stages are above it, usually decreasing in size.", "In parallel staging schemes Solid rocket booster solid or liquid rocket boosters are used to assist with launch.", "These are sometimes referred to as \"stage 0\".", "In the typical case, the first-stage and booster engines fire to propel the entire rocket upwards.", "When the boosters run out of fuel, they are detached from the rest of the rocket (usually with some kind of small explosive charge) and fall away.", "The first stage then burns to completion and falls off.", "This leaves a smaller rocket, with the second stage on the bottom, which then fires.", "Known in rocketry circles as staging, this process is repeated until the desired final velocity is achieved.", "In some cases with serial staging, the upper stage ignites ''before'' the separation\u2014the interstage ring is designed with this in mind, and the thrust is used to help positively separate the two vehicles.", "A multistage rocket is required to reach orbital speed.", "Single-stage-to-orbit designs are sought, but have not yet been demonstrated.", "The reason multi-stage rockets are required is the limitation the laws of physics place on the maximum velocity achievable by a rocket of given fueled-to-dry mass ratio.", "This relation is given by the classical rocket equation:\n: \nwhere:\n: is delta-v  of the vehicle (change of velocity plus losses due to gravity and atmospheric drag);\n: is the initial total (wet) mass, equal to final (dry) mass plus propellant; \n: is the final (dry) mass, after the propellant is expended; \n: is the effective exhaust velocity (determined by propellant, engine design and throttle condition);\n: is the natural logarithm function.", "The delta v required to reach low Earth orbit (or the required velocity of a sufficiently heavy suborbital payload) requires a wet to dry mass ratio larger than can realistically be achieved in a single rocket stage.", "The multistage rocket overcomes this limit by splitting the delta-v into fractions.", "As each lower stage drops off and the succeeding stage fires, the rest of the rocket is still traveling near the burnout speed.", "Each lower stage's dry mass includes the propellant in the upper stages, and each succeeding upper stage has reduced its dry mass by discarding the useless dry mass of the spent lower stages.", "A further advantage is that each stage can use a different type of rocket engine, each tuned for its particular operating conditions.", "Thus the lower-stage engines are designed for use at atmospheric pressure, while the upper stages can use engines suited to near vacuum conditions.", "Lower stages tend to require more structure than upper as they need to bear their own weight plus that of the stages above them.", "Optimizing the structure of each stage decreases the weight of the total vehicle and provides further advantage.", "The advantage of staging comes at the cost of the lower stages lifting engines which are not yet being used, as well as making the entire rocket more complex and harder to build than a single stage.", "In addition, each staging event is a possible point of launch failure, due to separation failure, ignition failure, or stage collision.", "Nevertheless, the savings are so great that every rocket ever used to deliver a payload into orbit has had staging of some sort.", "One of the most common measures of rocket efficiency is its specific impulse, which is defined as the thrust per flow rate (per second) of propellant consumption:\n:  = \nWhen rearranging the equation such that thrust is calculated as a result of the other factors, we have:\n: \nThese equations show that a higher specific impulse means a more efficient rocket engine, capable of burning for longer periods of time.", "In terms of staging, the initial rocket stages usually have a lower specific impulse rating, trading efficiency for superior thrust in order to quickly push the rocket into higher altitudes.", "Later stages of the rocket usually have a higher specific impulse rating because the vehicle is further outside the atmosphere and the exhaust gas does not need to expand against as much atmospheric pressure.", "When selecting the ideal rocket engine to use as an initial stage for a launch vehicle, a useful performance metric to examine is the thrust-to-weight ratio, and is calculated by the equation:\n: \nThe common thrust-to-weight ratio of a launch vehicle is within the range of 1.3 to 2.0.<ref name=\"larson\"/>\nAnother performance metric to keep in mind when designing each rocket stage in a mission is the burn time, which is the amount of time the rocket engine will last before it has exhausted all of its propellant.", "For most non-final stages, thrust and specific impulse can be assumed constant, which allows the equation for burn time to be written as:\n: \nWhere  and  are the initial and final masses of the rocket stage respectively.", "In conjunction with the burnout time, the burnout height and velocity are obtained using the same values, and are found by these two equations:\n: \n: \nWhen dealing with the problem of calculating the total burnout velocity or time for the entire rocket system, the general procedure for doing so is as follows:<ref name=\"larson\"/>\n# Partition the problem calculations into however many stages the rocket system comprises.", "# Calculate the initial and final mass for each individual stage.", "# Calculate the burnout velocity, and sum it with the initial velocity for each individual stage.", "Assuming each stage occurs immediately after the previous, the burnout velocity becomes the initial velocity for the following stage.", "# Repeat the previous two steps until the burnout time and/or velocity has been calculated for the final stage.", "It is important to note that the burnout time does not define the end of the rocket stage's motion, as the vehicle will still have a velocity that will allow it to coast upward for a brief amount of time until the acceleration of the planet's gravity gradually changes it to a downward direction.", "The velocity and altitude of the rocket after burnout can be easily modeled using the basic physics equations of motion.", "When comparing one rocket with another, it is impractical to directly compare the rocket's certain trait with the same trait of another because their individual attributes are often not independent of one another.", "For this reason, dimensionless ratios have been designed to enable a more meaningful comparison between rockets.", "The first is the initial to final mass ratio, which is the ratio between the rocket stage's full initial mass and the rocket stage's final mass once all of its fuel has been consumed.", "The equation for this ratio is:\n: \nWhere  is the empty mass of the stage,  is the mass of the propellant, and  is the mass of the payload.", "The second dimensionless performance quantity is the structural ratio, which is the ratio between the empty mass of the stage, and the combined empty mass and propellant mass as shown in this equation:<ref name=\"navid\" />\n: \nThe last major dimensionless performance quantity is the payload ratio, which is the ratio between the payload mass and the combined mass of the empty rocket stage and the propellant:\n: \nAfter comparing the three equations for the dimensionless quantities,  it is easy to see that they are not independent of each other, and in fact, the initial to final mass ratio can be rewritten in terms of structural ratio and payload ratio:<ref name=\"navid\" />\n: \nThese performance ratios can also be used as references for how efficient a rocket system will be when performing optimizations and comparing varying configurations for a mission.", "For initial sizing, the rocket equations can be used to derive the amount of propellant needed for the rocket based on the specific impulse of the engine and the total impulse required in N*s.  The equation is:\n: \nwhere g is the gravity constant of Earth.<ref name=\"larson\" />  This also enables the volume of storage required for the fuel to be calculated if the density of the fuel is known, which is almost always the case when designing the rocket stage.", "The volume is yielded when dividing the mass of the propellant by its density.", "Asides from the fuel required, the mass of the rocket structure itself must also be determined, which requires taking into account the mass of the required thrusters, electronics, instruments, power equipment, etc.<ref name=\"larson\" /> These are known quantities for typical off the shelf hardware that should be considered in the mid to late stages of the design, but for preliminary and conceptual design, a simpler approach can be taken.", "Assuming one engine for a rocket stage provides all of the total impulse for that particular segment, a mass fraction can be used to determine the mass of the system.", "The mass of the stage transfer hardware such as initiators and safe-and-arm devices are very small by comparison and can be considered negligible.", "For modern day solid rocket motors, it is a safe and reasonable assumption to say that 91 to 94 percent of the total mass is fuel.<ref name=\"larson\" />  It is also important to note there is a small percentage of \"residual\" propellant that will be left stuck and unusable inside the tank, and should also be taken into consideration when determining amount of fuel for the rocket.", "A common initial estimate for this residual propellant is five percent.", "With this ratio and the mass of the propellant calculated, the mass of the empty rocket weight can be determined.", "Sizing rockets using a liquid bipropellant requires a slightly more involved approach because of the fact that there are two separate tanks that are required:  One for the fuel, and one for the oxidizer.", "The ratio of these two quantities is known as the mixture ratio, and is defined by the equation:\n: \nWhere  is the mass of the oxidizer and  is the mass of the fuel.", "This mixture ratio not only governs the size of each tank, but also the specific impulse of the rocket.", "Determining the ideal mixture ratio is a balance of compromises between various aspects of the rocket being designed, and can vary depending on the type of fuel and oxidizer combination being used.", "For example, a mixture ratio of a bipropellant could be adjusted such that it may not have the optimal specific impulse, but will result in fuel tanks of equal size.", "This would yield simpler and cheaper manufacturing, packing, configuring, and integrating of the fuel systems with the rest of the rocket,<ref name=\"larson\" /> and can become a benefit that could outweigh the drawbacks of a less efficient specific impulse rating.", "But suppose the defining constraint for the launch system is volume, and a low density fuel is required such as hydrogen.", "This example would be solved by using an oxidizer-rich mixture ratio, reducing efficiency and specific impulse rating, but will meet a smaller tank volume requirement.", "The ultimate goal of optimal staging is to maximize the payload ratio (see ratios under performance), meaning the largest amount of payload is carried up to the required burnout velocity using the least amount of non-payload mass, which comprises everything else.", "Here are a few quick rules and guidelines to follow in order to reach optimal staging:<ref name=\"larson\" />\n#  Initial stages should have lower , and later/final stages should have higher .", "#  The stages with the lower  should contribute more \u0394V.", "# The next stage is always a smaller size than the previous stage.", "#  Similar stages should provide similar \u0394V.", "The payload ratio can be calculated for each individual stage, and when multiplied together in sequence, will yield the overall payload ratio of the entire system.", "It is important to note that when computing payload ratio for individual stages, the payload includes the mass of all the stages after the current one.", "The overall payload ratio is:\n: \nWhere n is the number of stages the rocket system comprises.", "Similar stages yielding the same payload ratio simplify this equation, however that is seldom the ideal solution for maximizing payload ratio, and \u0394V requirements may have to be partitioned unevenly as suggested in guideline tips 1 and 2 from above.", "Two common methods of determining this perfect \u0394V partition between stages are either a technical algorithm that generates an analytical solution that can be implemented by a program, or simple trial and error.<ref name=\"larson\" />  For the trial and error approach, it is best to begin with the final stage, calculating the initial mass which becomes the payload for the previous stage.", "From there it is easy to progress all the way down to the initial stage in the same manner, sizing all the stages of the rocket system.", "Restricted rocket staging is based on the simplified assumption that each of the stages of the rocket system have the same specific impulse, structural ratio, and payload ratio, the only difference being the total mass of each increasing stage is less than that of the previous stage.", "Although this assumption may not be the ideal approach to yielding an efficient or optimal system, it greatly simplifies the equations for determining the burnout velocities, burnout times, burnout altitudes, and mass of each stage.", "This would make for a better approach to a conceptual design in a situation where a basic understanding of the system behavior is preferential to a detailed, accurate design.", "One important concept to understand when undergoing restricted rocket staging, is how the burnout velocity is affected by the number of stages that split up the rocket system.", "Increasing the number of stages for a rocket while keeping the specific impulse, payload ratios and structural ratios constant will always yield a higher burnout velocity than the same systems that use fewer stages.", "However, the law of diminishing returns is evident in that each increment in number of stages gives less of an improvement in burnout velocity than the previous increment.", "The burnout velocity gradually converges towards an asymptotic value as the number of stages increases towards a very high number.<ref name=\"navid\" />  In addition to diminishing returns in burnout velocity improvement, the main reason why real world rockets seldom use more than three stages is because of increase of weight and complexity in the system for each added stage, ultimately yielding a higher cost for deployment.", "A rocket system that implements tandem staging means that each individual stage runs in order one after the other.", "The rocket breaks free from the previous stage, then begins burning through the next stage in straight succession.", "On the other hand, a rocket that implements parallel staging has two or more different stages that are active at the same time.", "For example, the space shuttle rocket has two side boosters that burn simultaneously.", "Upon launch, the boosters ignite, and at the end of the stage, the two boosters are discarded while the main rocket tank is kept for another stage.<ref name=\"larson\"/>  \nMost quantitative approaches to the design of the rocket system's performance are focused on tandem staging, but the approach can be easily modified to include parallel staging.", "To begin with, the different stages of the rocket should be clearly defined.", "Continuing with the previous example, the end of the first stage which is sometimes referred to as 'stage 0', can be defined as when the side boosters separate from the main rocket.", "From there, the final mass of stage one can be considered the sum of the empty mass of stage one, the mass of stage two (the main rocket and the remaining unburned fuel) and the mass of the payload.", "High-altitude and space-bound upper stages are designed to operate with little or no atmospheric pressure.", "This allows the use of lower pressure combustion chambers and engine nozzles with optimal Rocket engine nozzle#Aerostatic back-pressure and optimum expansion vacuum expansion ratios.", "Some upper stages, especially those using hypergolic propellants like Delta-K or Ariane 5 Ariane 5 ES second stage, are Pressure-fed engine pressure fed, which eliminates the need for complex turbopumps.", "Other upper stages, such as the Centaur (rocket stage) Centaur or Delta Cryogenic Second Stage DCSS, use liquid hydrogen expander cycle engines, or Gas-generator cycle gas generator cycle engines like the Ariane 5 ECA's HM7B or the S-IVB's Rocketdyne J-2 J-2.", "These stages are usually tasked with completing orbital injection and accelerating payloads into higher energy orbits such as Geostationary transfer orbit GTO or to escape velocity.", "Upper stages, such as Fregat, used primarily to bring payloads from low Earth orbit to GTO or beyond are sometimes referred to as space tugs.<ref >{{Cite web\n   url =

site and shipped to the launch site; the term ''vehicle assembly'' refers to the mating of all rocket stage(s) and the spacecraft payload into a single assembly known as a space vehicle.", "Single-stage vehicles (suborbital flight suborbital), and multistage vehicles on the smaller end of the size range, can usually be assembled directly on the launch pad by lifting the stage(s) and spacecraft vertically in place by means of a crane.", "This is generally not practical for larger space vehicles, which are assembled off the pad and moved into place on the launch site by various methods.", "NASA's Apollo program Apollo/Saturn V manned Moon landing vehicle, and  Space Shuttle, were assembled vertically onto mobile launcher platforms with attached launch umbilical towers, in a Vehicle Assembly Building, and then a special crawler-transporter moved the entire vehicle stack to the launch pad in an upright position.", "In contrast, vehicles such as the Russian Soyuz (rocket family) Soyuz rocket and the SpaceX Falcon 9 are assembled horizontally in a processing hangar, transported horizontally, and then brought upright at the pad.", "Spent upper stages of launch vehicles are a significant source of space debris :Derelict satellites orbiting Earth remaining in orbit in a non-operational state for many years after use, and occasionally, large debris fields created from

due to the breaking up of rocket upper stages, particularly Passivation (spacecraft) unpassivated upper-stage propulsion units.", "An illustration and description in the 14th century History of China Chinese ''Huolongjing'' by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen shows the oldest known multistage rocket; this was the \"Huolongchushui fire-dragon issuing from the water\" (\u706b\u9f99\u51fa\u6c34, hu\u01d2

points out that the written material and depicted illustration of this rocket come from the oldest stratum of the ''Huolongjing'', which can be dated roughly 1300\u20131350 AD (from the book's part 1,

be ejected.", "This is more efficient than sequential staging, because the second-stage engine is never just dead weight.", "In 1951, Soviet engineer and scientist Dmitry Okhotsimsky carried out a pioneering engineering study of general sequential and parallel staging, with and without the pumping of fuel between stages.", "The design of the R-7 Semyorka emerged from that study.", "The trio of rocket engines used in the first stage of the American Atlas I and Atlas II launch vehicles, arranged in a row, used parallel staging in a similar way: the outer pair of booster engines existed as a

airflow that lead to problems in control.", "For instance, the Lockheed P-38 Lightning P-38 Lightning with its thick high-lift wing had a particular problem in high-speed dives that led to a nose-down condition.", "Pilots would enter dives, and then find that they could no longer control the plane, which continued to nose over until it crashed.", "The problem was remedied by adding a \"dive flap\" beneath the wing which altered the center of pressure distribution so that the wing would not lose its lift.", "A similar problem affected some models of the Supermarine Spitfire.", "At high speeds, the ailerons could apply more torque than the Spitfire's thin wings could handle, and the entire wing would twist in the opposite direction.", "This meant that the plane would roll in the direction opposite to that which the pilot intended, and led to a number of accidents.", "Earlier models weren't fast enough for this to be a problem, and so it wasn't noticed until later model Spitfires like the Mk.IX started to appear.", "This was mitigated by adding considerable torsional rigidity to the wings, and was wholly cured when the Mk.XIV was introduced.", "The Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Mitsubishi A6M Zero Mitsubishi Zero had the exact opposite problem in which the controls became ineffective.", "At higher speeds, the pilot simply couldn't move the controls because there was too much

prevents aerodynamic forces overriding the pilots' control inputs.", "Finally, another common problem that fits into this category is Aeroelasticity flutter.", "At some speeds, the airflow over the

control off completely.", "This was a serious problem on the Zero and VL Myrsky.", "When problems with poor control at high speed were first encountered, they were addressed by designing a new style of control surface with more power.", "However, this introduced a new resonant mode, and a number of planes were lost before this was discovered.", "On design of VL Myrsky, this problem was countered by increasing the rigidity and weight of the wing, therefore increasing the dampening of the harmonic oscillation, which compromised the performance to some extent.", "All of these effects are often mentioned in conjunction with the term \"compressibility\", but in a manner of speaking, they are incorrectly used.", "From a strictly aerodynamic point of view, the term should refer only to those side-effects arising as a result of the changes in airflow from an incompressible fluid (similar in effect to water) to a compressible fluid (acting as a gas) as the speed of sound is approached.", "There are two effects in particular, wave drag and critical mach.", "Wave drag is a sudden rise in drag on the aircraft, caused by air building up in front of it.", "At lower speeds, this air has time to \"get out of the way\", guided by the air in front of it that is in contact with the aircraft.", "But at the speed of sound, this can no longer happen, and the air which was previously following the Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines streamline around the aircraft now hits it directly.", "The amount of power needed to overcome this effect is considerable.", "The critical mach is the speed at which some of the air passing over the aircraft's wing becomes supersonic.", "At the speed of sound, the way that lift is generated changes dramatically, from being dominated by Bernoulli's principle to forces generated by shock waves.", "Since the air on the top of the wing is traveling faster than on the bottom, due to Bernoulli effect, at speeds close to the speed of sound the air on the top of the wing will be accelerated to supersonic.", "When this happens, the distribution of lift changes dramatically, typically causing a powerful nose-down trim.", "Since the aircraft normally approached these speeds only in a dive, pilots would report the aircraft attempting to nose over into the ground.", "Dissociation absorbs a great deal of energy in a reversible process.", "This greatly reduces the thermodynamic temperature of hypersonic gas decelerated near an aerospace vehicle.", "In transition regions, where this pressure dependent dissociation is  incomplete, both the differential, constant pressure heat capacity and beta (the volume/pressure differential ratio) will greatly increase.", "The latter has a pronounced effect on vehicle aerodynamics including stability.", "As aircraft began to travel faster, aerodynamicists realized that the density of air began to change as it came into contact with an object, leading to a division of fluid flow into the incompressible and Compressible flow compressible regimes.", "In compressible aerodynamics, density and pressure both change, which is the basis for calculating the speed of sound.", "Newton was the first to develop a mathematical model for calculating the speed of sound, but it was not correct until Pierre-Simon Laplace accounted for the molecular behavior of gases and

high-purity fused quartz, it is possible to reach a Q-factor of over 30-50 million in vacuum, thus the corresponding random walks are extremely low.", "The Q-factor is limited by the coating (extremely thin film of gold or platinum) and by fixture losses.", "Such resonators have to be fine-tuned by ion-beam micro-erosion of the glass or by laser ablation in order to be perfectly dynamically balanced.", "When coated, tuned and assembled within the housing, the Q-factor remains over 10 million.", "In application to the HRG shell, Coriolis forces cause a precession of vibration patterns around the axis of rotation.", "It causes a slow precession of a standing wave around this axis, with an angular rate that differs from input one.", "This is the wave inertia effect, discovered in 1890 by British scientist George Hartley Bryan (1864\u20131928).", "Therefore, when subject to rotation around the shell symmetry axis, the standing wave does not rotate exactly with the shell, but the difference between both rotations is nevertheless perfectly proportional to the input rotation.", "The device is then able to sense rotation.", "The electronics which sense the standing waves are also able to drive them.", "Therefore, the gyros can operate in either a \u201cwhole angle mode\u201d that sense the standing waves' position or a \u201cforce rebalance mode\u201d that holds

attack increases.", "This occurs when the critical angle of attack of the foil is exceeded.", "The critical angle of attack is typically about 15 degrees, but it may vary significantly depending on the fluid, foil, and Reynolds number.", "Stalls in fixed-wing flight are often experienced as a sudden reduction in lift as the pilot increases the wing's angle of attack and exceeds its critical angle of attack (which may be due to slowing down below Stall (fluid dynamics)#Stall speeds stall speed in level flight).", "A stall does not mean that the engine(s) have stopped working, or that the aircraft has stopped moving\u2014the effect is the same even in an unpowered glider aircraft.", "Thrust vectoring Vectored thrust in manned and unmanned aircraft is used to maintain altitude or controlled flight with wings stalled by replacing lost wing lift with engine or propeller thrust, thereby giving rise to post-stall technology.", "Because stalls are most commonly discussed in connection with aviation, this article discusses stalls as they relate mainly to aircraft, in particular fixed-wing aircraft.", "The principles of stall discussed here translate to foils in other fluids as well.", "A stall is a condition in aerodynamics and aviation such that if the angle of attack increases beyond a certain point then lift begins to decrease.", "The angle at which this occurs is called the ''critical angle of attack''.", "This critical angle is dependent upon the airfoil section or profile of the wing, its planform (aeronautics) planform, its aspect ratio (aeronautics) aspect ratio, and other factors, but is typically in the range of 8 to 20 degrees relative to the incoming wind (\"relative wind\") for most subsonic airfoils.", "The critical angle of attack is the angle of attack on the lift coefficient versus angle-of-attack (Cl~alpha) curve at which the maximum lift coefficient occurs.", "Stalling is caused by flow separation which, in turn, is caused by the air flowing against a rising pressure.", "Whitford describes three types of stall, trailing-edge, leading-edge and thin-aerofoil, each with distinctive Cl~alpha features.", "For the trailing-edge stall separation begins at small angles of attack near the trailing edge of the wing while the rest of the flow over the wing remains attached.", "As angle of attack increases, the separated regions on the top of the wing increase in size as the flow separation moves forwards and this hinders the ability of the wing to create lift.", "This is shown by the reduction in lift-slope on a Cl~alpha curve as the lift nears its maximum value.", "The separated flow usually causes buffeting.", "Beyond the critical angle of attack, separated flow is so dominant that additional increases in angle of attack cause the lift to fall from its peak value.", "Piston-engined and early jet transports had very good stall behaviour with pre-stall buffet warning and, if ignored, a straight nose-drop for a natural recovery.", "Wing developments that came with the introduction of turbo-prop engines introduced unacceptable stall behaviour.", "Leading-edge developments on high-lift wings and the introduction of rear-mounted engines and high-set tailplanes on the next generation of jet transports also introduced unacceptable stall behaviour.", "The probability of achieving the stall speed inadvertently, a potentially hazardous event, had been calculated, in 1965, at about once in every 100,000 flights, often enough to justify the cost of development and incorporation of warning devices, such as stick shakers, and devices to automatically provide an adequate nose-down pitch, such as stick pushers.", "When the mean angle of attack of the wings is beyond the stall a spin (aerodynamics) spin, which is an autorotation (fixed-wing aircraft) autorotation of a stalled wing, may develop.", "A spin follows departures in roll, yaw and pitch from balanced flight.", "For example, a roll is naturally damped with an unstalled wing but with wings stalled the damping moment is replaced with a propelling moment.", "The graph shows that the greatest amount of lift is produced as the critical angle of attack is reached (which in early-20th century aviation was called the \"burble point\").", "This angle is 17.5 degrees in this case, but it varies from airfoil to airfoil.", "In particular, for aerodynamically thick airfoils (thickness to Chord (aircraft) chord ratios of around 10%), the critical angle is higher than with a thin airfoil of the same camber (aerodynamics) camber.", "Symmetric airfoils have lower critical angles (but also work efficiently in inverted flight).", "The graph shows that, as the angle of attack exceeds the critical angle, the lift produced by the airfoil decreases.", "The information in a graph of this kind is gathered using a model of the airfoil in a wind tunnel.", "Because aircraft models are normally used, rather than full-size machines, special care is needed to make sure that data is taken in the same Reynolds number regime (or scale speed) as in free flight.", "The separation of flow from the upper wing surface at high angles of attack is quite different at low Reynolds number from that at the high Reynolds numbers of real aircraft.", "High-pressure wind tunnels are one solution to this problem.", "In general, steady operation of an aircraft at an angle of attack above the critical angle is not possible because, after exceeding the critical angle, the loss of lift from the wing causes the nose of the aircraft to fall, reducing the angle of attack again.", "This nose drop, independent of control inputs, indicates the pilot has actually stalled the aircraft.", "This graph shows the stall angle, yet in practice most pilot operating handbooks (POH) or generic flight manuals describe stalling in terms of airspeed.", "This is because all aircraft are equipped with an airspeed indicator, but fewer aircraft have an angle of attack indicator.", "An aircraft's stalling speed is published by the manufacturer (and is required for certification by flight testing) for a range of weights and flap positions, but the stalling angle of attack is not published.", "As speed reduces, angle of attack has to increase to keep lift constant until the critical angle is reached.", "The airspeed at which this angle is reached is the (1g, unaccelerated) stalling speed of the aircraft in that particular configuration.", "Deploying flap (aircraft) flaps/slats decreases the stall speed to allow the aircraft to take off and land at a lower speed.", "A fixed-wing aircraft can be made to stall in any Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft) pitch attitude or bank angle or at any airspeed but deliberate stalling is commonly practiced by reducing the speed to the unaccelerated stall speed, at a safe altitude.", "Unaccelerated (1g) stall speed varies on different fixed-wing aircraft and is represented by colour codes on the airspeed indicator.", "As the plane flies at this speed, the angle of attack must be increased to prevent any loss of altitude or gain in airspeed (which corresponds to the stall angle described above).", "The pilot will notice the aircraft flight control system flight controls have become less responsive and may also notice some buffeting, a result of the turbulent air separated from the wing hitting the tail of the aircraft.", "In most light aircraft, as the stall is reached, the aircraft will start to descend (because the wing is no longer producing enough lift to support the aircraft's weight) and the nose will pitch down.", "Recovery from the stall involves lowering the aircraft nose, to decrease the angle of attack and increase the air speed, until smooth air-flow over the wing is restored.", "Normal flight can be resumed once recovery is complete.", "The maneuver is normally quite safe, and, if correctly handled, leads to only a small loss in altitude (20\u201330&nbsp;m/50\u2013100&nbsp;ft).", "It is taught and practised in order for pilots to recognize, avoid, and recover from stalling the aircraft.", "A pilot is required to demonstrate competency in controlling an aircraft during and after a stall for certification in the United States, and it is a routine maneuver for pilots when getting to know the handling of an unfamiliar aircraft type.", "The only dangerous aspect of a stall is a lack of altitude for recovery.", "A special form of asymmetric stall in which the aircraft also rotates about its yaw axis is called a Spin (aerodynamics) spin.", "A spin can occur if an aircraft is stalled and there is an asymmetric yawing moment applied to it.", "This yawing moment can be aerodynamic (sideslip angle, rudder, adverse yaw from the ailerons), thrust related (p-factor, one engine inoperative on a multi-engine non-centreline thrust aircraft), or from less likely sources such as severe turbulence.", "The net effect is that one wing is stalled before the other and the aircraft descends rapidly while rotating, and some aircraft cannot recover from this condition without correct pilot control inputs (which must stop yaw) and loading.", "A new solution to the problem of difficult (or impossible) stall-spin recovery is provided by the ballistic parachute recovery system.", "The most common stall-spin scenarios occur on takeoff (departure resistance departure stall) and during landing (base to final turn) because of insufficient airspeed during these maneuvers.", "Stalls also occur during a go-around manoeuvre if the pilot does not properly respond to the out-of-trim situation resulting from the transition from low power setting to high power setting at low speed.", "Stall speed is increased when the wing surfaces are Atmospheric icing contaminated with ice or frost creating a rougher surface, and heavier airframe due to ice accumulation.", "Stalls occur not only at slow airspeed, but at any speed when the wings exceed their critical angle of attack.", "Attempting to increase the angle of attack at 1g by moving the control column back normally causes the aircraft to climb.", "However, aircraft often experience higher g-forces, such as when turning steeply or pulling out of a dive.", "In these cases, the wings are already operating at a higher angle of attack to create the necessary force (derived from lift) to accelerate in the desired direction.", "Increasing the g-loading still further, by pulling back on the controls, can cause the stalling angle to be exceeded, even though the aircraft is flying at a high speed.", "These \"high-speed stalls\" produce the same buffeting characteristics as 1g stalls and can also initiate a spin if there is also any yawing.", "Different aircraft types have different stalling characteristics but they only have to be good enough to satisfy their particular Airworthiness authority.", "For example, the Short Belfast heavy freighter  had a marginal nose drop which was acceptable to the Royal Air Force.", "When the aircraft were sold to a civil operator they had to be fitted with a stick pusher to meet the civil

first characterized.", "Richard Seebass and his colleague Albert George at Cornell University studied the problem extensively and eventually defined a \"figure of merit\" (FM) to characterize the sonic boom levels of different aircraft.", "FM is a function of the aircraft weight and the aircraft length.", "The lower this value, the less boom the aircraft generates, with figures of about 1 or lower being considered acceptable.", "Using this calculation, they found FMs of about 1.4 for Concorde and 1.9 for the Boeing 2707.", "This eventually doomed most SST projects as public resentment, mixed with politics, eventually resulted in laws that made any such aircraft impractical (flying supersonically only over water for instance).", "Another way to express this is wing span.", "The fuselage of even a large supersonic aircraft is very sleek and with enough angle of attack and wing span the plane can fly so high that the boom by the fuselage is not important.", "The larger the wing span, the greater the downwards impulse which can be applied to the air, the greater the boom felt.", "A smaller wing span favors small aeroplane designs like business jets.<ref

downwards-focused (SR-71 Blackbird, Boeing X-43) shock at a sharp, but wide angle nose cone, which will travel at slightly supersonic speed (Shock wave bow shock), and using a swept back flying wing or an Oblique wing oblique flying wing to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight (the tail of the shock travels at sonic speed).", "To adapt this principle to existing planes, which generate a shock at their nose cone and an even stronger one at their wing leading edge, the fuselage below the wing is shaped according to the area rule.", "Ideally this would raise the

MacNeal, published in 1971,<ref name='Burton-Coverstone 2010' /> and consists of multiple rotating blades attached to a central hub.", "The Heliogyro spacecraft's Attitude control attitude (orientation), and therefore thrust direction, would be controlled by changing the cyclic and collective blade pitch similar to a helicopter.", "Although the Heliogyro design has no mass advantage over a square sail, it remains attractive because the method of deploying large sail blades is simpler than a strut-based design.", "Blade stiffness is achieved by spinning the spacecraft (centrifugal force) with its  rotational axis generally pointing at the Sun.", "The University of Illinois together with CU Aerospace designed this mission to demonstrate deployment and to measure the thrust on a

intended as a first step towards the development of the larger solar sail concept called UltraSail.", "Re-orientation of the CubeSats will cause the sail to undergo aerodynamic drag in the upper atmosphere for its disposal.", "The spacecraft was selected in 2012 by NASA to be launched as part of the Educational Launch of Nanosatellites ELaNa program.", "CubeSail was launched on an Electron (rocket) Electron launch vehicle on 16 December 2018 from New Zealand.", "The proposed second mission of the project is called I-Sail, proposed to be launched in 2022, and would consist of a

costs on the rise, quadjets are much less attractive to airlines shifting their attention towards more efficient aircraft types.", "Four engines also incur higher maintenance costs, as each one needs to undergo regular inspections and servicing.", "Approximately half of the airliner maintenance costs are derived from routine engine maintenance, so the additional expense in maintaining four engines is significant.", "The ability of a very large aircraft to carry an equally large number of passengers can be a drawback when the seats are not filled.", "This is an emerging trend, particularly because the airline industry has been transitioning from a Spoke-hub distribution model spoke-hub model to a Point-to-point transit point-to-point model.", "Conversely, the point-to-point model transports passengers directly from origin to destination, spreading them out across different routes and requiring fewer seats on the servicing aircraft.", "Prior to the Jet Age, airliners were powered by Reciprocating engine piston engines.", "Engine failures were relatively common, so providing redundancy with four engines was important for long range flights.", "This need extended into the beginning of the Jet Age, and combined with the limited thrust available from early jet engines, it was most practical to design large jet airliners with four engines.", "The first commercial jet aircraft was the four-engined De Havilland Comet, which first flew in 1949.", "This greatly tarnished its reputation and it was the later airliners that truly benefited from the subsequent improvements.", "In 1958, Boeing introduced the Boeing 707 707 and a year later, Douglas Aircraft Company Douglas rolled out its Douglas DC-8 DC-8, both types also with four engines.", "Both were very successful and the 707 in particular is credited with advancing the Jet Age.", "The large airliners flourished during this period, frequently operating on both domestic and international routes.", "By the 1960s it became apparent that having four engines reduced fuel efficiency.", "This was not an issue for long-haul routes which carried 300 or more passengers for 8 to 12 hours, allowing for a high cost-to-passenger-mile ratio.", "On the other hand, the large four-engined types were less suited for frequent short-haul services, which demanded multiple take-offs and landings daily, costing more fuel while also typically carrying fewer passengers per flight.", "This prompted the development of large trijets and twinjets.", "Trijets represented a compromise between fuel efficiency and redundancy.", "In 1969, Boeing launched the Boeing 747 747.", "Nicknamed the \"Jumbo Jet\", it was the first Wide-bodied aircraft wide-body airliner, able to carry significantly more passengers than

"This prompted the introduction of ETOPS ratings for twinjets, allowing them to circumvent the 60-Minute Rule and fly on transoceanic routes previously serviced by four-engined types.", "The advantage of redundancy brought by four engines was no longer necessary and they could no longer compete with the lower fuel consumption and maintenance costs of twinjets with higher-powered engines.", "All but

even higher-capacity four-engined designs arrived when Boeing launched the Boeing 747-400 747-400 in 1989 and Airbus launched its Airbus A340 A340 in 1993.", "Both had high capacities (over 300 passengers) and long range, a combination still unmatched by twins at the time, and so were commercially successful.", "When the British Aerospace 146 BAe 146 was introduced in 1983, it was unusual because it was a four-engined short range regional airliner.", "Its design ultimately enabled quieter operation and STOL short take off and landing capabilities.", "The final major advantage of four engines, their potential for very large capacities, became much less significant when the twin-engined Boeing 777 was introduced in 1995.", "The original Boeing 777 777-200 could seat upwards of 300 passengers, a significant increase upon existing twinjets such as the Boeing 767 767, which could typically only seat 200-300 passengers.", "The subsequent development of the Boeing 777 777-300ER pushed the passenger capacity to just under 400, approaching the Boeing 747 747 and superseding the Airbus A340 A340, while being more efficient and incurring lower engine maintenance costs.", "The Airbus A330 twin underwent a similar evolution, culminating with the 330-seat Airbus A330 A330-300.", "By the early 2000s, the only remaining advantage of the largest types was their ability to carry more passengers than the largest twinjets.", "In the years following the September 11 attacks, the increase in fuel prices and decline in the aviation industry heightened the need to minimise operating costs and expenditures.", "The use of four engines was invigorated in 2005 when Airbus introduced the Airbus A380 A380, currently the world's largest airliner.", "It was designed for routes with ultra-high demand, typically seating 575 passengers in two full-length decks.", "However, as of 2018, Airbus has only fulfilled a quarter of its initial projected figure of 1,200 sales over two decades.", "This can be attributed to a modern trend towards Point-to-point transit point-to-point travel using smaller but highly efficient twinjets such as the Airbus A350 XWB Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner Boeing 787, as opposed to a Spoke-hub distribution model spoke-hub model which favours massive aircraft such as the A380.", "The largest operator of the A380, Emirates (airline) Emirates, profits from its fleet because its primary hub is situated at Dubai International Airport, where many long-haul routes have their stopovers.", "This allows Emirates to fill the seats of its A380s.", "As engine power continued to grow and capacity demands decreased, twinjet aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 XWB ate into the markets that traditionally demanded four engines.", "In response to the A380, Boeing introduced the Boeing 747-8 747-8 in 2011 as a successor to the 747\u2013400.", "The 747-8I passenger variant has only received 50 orders as of 2018, while
